Within nature, there exist four fundamental forces governing the interactions of particles with one another:  electromagnetism, the nuclear weak force, the nuclear strong force, and gravity.  This work seeks to probe the nature of the weak nuclear force on its most fundamental level through observations of beta decay, a process which results directly from the action of the weak nuclear force.  Through kinematic observations of the decay products, much can be learned about the form of the weak nuclear force's coupling, through which beta decay proceeds.  Prior experiments have shown that this coupling is dominated by a combination of operators that behave as vectors and axial-vectors under Lorentz transformation, however 
%vector and axial-vector operators, but 
the possibility of a non-dominant contribution from other types of operators, such as scalars and tensors, cannot be ruled out entirely.  This is the domain of precision measurements.  

\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}
Within our present understanding of physics, there are four fundamental forces governing the interactions of particles with one another:  electromagnetism, the nuclear weak force, the nuclear strong force, and gravity.  These forces are considered to be distinct from one another by virtue of their differing behaviours, however attempting to unify them within a single theoretical framework has been a major focus of later 20th- and early 21st-century physics to date.  The effort has been met with only partial success, and the resulting theoretical framework is collectively known as the \ac{SM}~\cite{griffiths_particles}.

The standard model provides a quantum mechanical description for
the behaviour of three of the four fundamental forces:  electromagnetism, the nuclear weak force, and the nuclear strong force.  The \ac{SM} notably does not describe gravitational processes --- despite extensive efforts, the gravitational force has thus far defied all attempts to describe it in a fully quantum mechanical way, though this remains an active field of research~\cite{peskinandschroeder}.  

%
Each force has its own specific mediating particle(s) which couple only to a particular type of (generalized) charge, and therefore interact only with particles that possess that charge.  For example, the gravitational charge is \emph{mass}, and (at least within a simplified particle physics model) gravity acts only on objects that possess mass.~\aside{Can I turn this into a footnote?  It's not true because the curvature of spacetime also affects photon trajectories, and there even exist (unstable) (quasi-?) bound states comprised *only* of photons, as in e.g. Aichelburg-Sexl.}  With only a single type of charge and no negative masses, the gravitational force can only ever be attractive.
%
By constrast, the electromagnetic force couples to both positive and negative electric charges, and can produce both attractive and repulsive forces.  Both the electromagnetic and gravitational forces are mediated by massless force-carrying particles (the photon and still-theoretical graviton, respectively), a property which implies that the amount of flux per unit solid angle is constant over all distance scales, and Gauss's Law holds true.

In the case of the nuclear weak force, which will be the primary concern within this thesis, 
the notion of generalized charge is no longer entirely straightforward to apply.
We must rely instead on a list of allowed Feynman diagram vertices to describe the types of interaction that are possible (see Fig.~\ref{fig:feynmandiagrams_general}).  We note that the weak force involves three mediating particles --- $W^+$, $W^-$, and $Z^0$ bosons --- and these mediators can interact with both (anti-)quarks and (anti-)leptons.  The $W^+$ and $W^-$ particles also carry electric charge, which must be separately conserved in any interaction,~\aside{(wait, is that true?  what about with the photon vertex? ....I think it's fine.....} but the $Z^0$ is electrically neutral.  All three are massive, which implies that the strength of the weak force falls off more rapidly as distance increases, and Gauss's Law does not apply. 


With a comparatively large number of possible vertex types, it can be challenging to develop an intuition about the behaviour of the weak force. 
Perhaps the most well known physical behaviour that arises from the nuclear weak force is beta decay. 
Indeed, beta decay
offers one of the most readily accessible experimental windows to the workings of the nuclear weak force.

Although it is now generally well understood, beta decay still presents a unique opportunity for precision measurements to search for exotic physics beyond the Standard Model within the weak coupling.
By observing the kinematics and angular correlations involved in the decay process, one gains access to a wealth of information about the 
laws underpinning the decay process, and the weak force as a whole.

\section{A Historical Look at Beta Decay and the Weak Interaction}

We consider the historical development of our scientific understanding of beta decay and the nuclear weak force.  This is a historically rich topic, and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this document, however we shall attempt to touch on some highlights.

Radioactivity was first observed in 1896 by Henri Becquerel in uranium, and this landmark discovery set off a flurry of activity in the field~\cite{becquerel1896}.
Ernest Rutherford noted in 1899 that the particles emitted by a sample of uranium could be classified into two groups based on how readily they were absorbed in materials -- alpha particles are easily absorbed, while beta particles are more penetrating~\cite{rutherford1899}.  A third and even more penetrating type of radioactive emission was observed in 1900 by Paul Villard, who made no attempt to give it a name -- but within a few years, Rutherford's naming convention had been applied and this third type of particle became known as a gamma ray~\cite{villard1900,rutherford1903}.  

\note{Rutherford discovered that:  half-life.  [76]=E. Rutherford, \emph{Phil. Mag.} \textbf{49}, 1, 1900.  Thorium.  Rn220.  ...but also, *I* got this from Abraham Pais.}

When, in 1900, Becquerel measured the charge-to-mass ratio of emitted beta ($\beta^-$) radiation and found that it was the same as that of the electron, he proposed that these must be the same particle~\cite{becquerel1900},~\aside{I think.  Also, I think that's the right citation..} and in 1903~\aside{or possibly 1901?} Rutherford and Soddy demonstrated that the processes of alpha and beta decay both transmute the original chemical element into another~\cite{rutherfordsoddy1903}.


Despite these early successes, in 1911 Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn noticed that beta particles are emitted with a variety of different kinetic energies~\cite{hahn1911new}, and in 1914 James Chadwick

demonstrated that energies of emitted beta particles formed a continuous distribution~\cite{chadwick1914}.  The physics community was baffled for years by the fact that it seemed impossible to predict the energy of a beta particle emitted by a particular process;  if the emitted beta simply took on the difference in energy between the initial and final states, then surely that energy should be a fixed, unchanging value for a paricular transition. 

%should be a fixed amount of energy for a given transition.  
Finally, in 1930, a frustrated Wolfgang Pauli famously proposed that if an additional small, neutral, difficult to detect particle were emitted simultaneously with the beta and allowed to carry away a varying amount of energy, then this accounting trick could account for the continuous beta energy spectrum~\cite{PauliNeutrino1978}.

%When Enrico Fermi offered a quantitative description of 
Pauli's 1930 insight paved the way for Enrico Fermi to propose a quantitative description of the nuclear weak force and the beta decay processes resulting from it.  He modeled the weak force as a contact interaction with zero range --- a very good approximation.  After being rejected by \emph{Nature} in 1933, Fermi's seminal theory of beta decay was published in both Italian and German journals the following year~\cite{AbrahamPais,Fermi1934Italian,Fermi1934German}.

Because of its powerful predictive ability together with its generalized quantum mechanical approach, Fermi's model forms the basis upon which modern beta decay calculations have been built.  With one of its major results, now commonly known as Fermi's Golden Rule, still routinely used, the introduction of Fermi's model arguably marks the beginning of our modern understanding of beta decay.

The mid 1930s was a busy time 
%1934 was a busy year 
for our understanding of beta decay.  In addition to the publication of Fermi's model in 1934~\cite{Fermi1934Italian,Fermi1934German}, this year also marks the first discovery of $\beta^+$ radiation, for which Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie later received a Nobel prize~\cite{joliotcurie1934, nobelprize_1935}, and the proposal by Gian-Carlo Wick of the electron capture mechanism for beta decay~\cite{guerra2009enrico, wick1934sugli}.  
The electron capture theory was fleshed out further in 1935-1936 by Yukawa and Sakata~\cite{yukawa1,yukawa2,yukawa3}\aside{and others?  Also, Yukawa and Sakata first names?} and first observed in 1937 by Luis Alvarez~\cite{alvarez1937}.  Meanwhile, in 1936 George Gamow and Edward Teller improved upon Fermi's model by including a mechanism to potentially change the nuclear spin~\cite{GamowTeller}, and to this day, beta decay transitions are still routinely classified as following Fermi or Gamow-Teller (or mixed) selection rules.

Over the next few years, developments within the field of nuclear physics were largely directed elsewhere, but beta decay returned to scientific prominence with T. D. Lee and C. N.

%\note{... a discovery which earned Lee and Yang a Nobel prize.  Wu's discovery earned Lee and Yang the 1957 Nobel Prize.}

Subsequent experiments demonstrated that not only was parity non-conserved in a beta decay transition, it is (as near as we can collectively tell) \emph{maximally} violated.  \aside{cite someone for maximal parity violation.}
Though early experiments suggested that the couplings were likely comprised of 
%so-called 
scalar and tensor interactions,\aside{cite someone for S,T !  John suggests 6He $\abetanu$ for the tensor.} Feynman and Gell-Mann first postulated the correct $(V-A)$ form of the interaction in 1958 by invoking an analogy with the photon, and this was eventually borne out by experimental evidence~\cite{FeynmanGellMann1958}.  (See Sec.~\ref{sec:SMandBeyond} for further discussion on the form of weak interaction couplings.)
\aside{cite someone for $(V-A)$ evidence}

In the following years, the theory behind the nuclear weak force was developed further, and eventually merged with the theory of electromagnetism as the electroweak force.  The framework for \ac{QED} had already been largely developed between 1946 and 1950 by Shinichiro Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, and others.  The theory was fully covariant, meaning that it behaves properly under a Lorentz transformation.  The work of Schwinger, and independently, Tomonaga, developed much of the methodology behind renormalization, which is now considered to be a mathematical necessity in any modern quantum field theory~\cite{tomonaga1946,schwinger1948covariant,feynman1949spacetime,feynman1949positrons,feynman1950,dyson1949theories}.  ~\aside{QED as a "template" for other theories.}

}

Following the success of QED, there was a push from the physics community to create a similar theory to model the nuclear weak force.  
%
Lee and Yang, and Feynman and Gell-Mann, produced two notable early examples of a weak force Lagrangian written, like the theory of electromagnetism, in terms of Lorentz-transforming currents~\cite{LeeYang,FeynmanGellMann1958}.  Yang and Mills took a more mathematical approach, and their 1954 non-abelian gauge theory \cite{YangMills1954} lies at the foundation of electroweak unification.  
%

In 1961, Sheldon Glashow extended some of Schwinger's work to model the nuclear weak force,  adding an explicit mass term (i.e., to make the force mediating particles massive).  The model included the $W^+$ and $W^-$ bosons needed to explain beta decay, and for the first time, a neutral $Z^0$ boson.  With the explicit mass term, the theory was not renormalizable, and since there had been no experimental hint of the $Z^0$, Glashow himself discounted the model, and it initially received little attention.  In 1964, Abdus Salam and John Clive Ward proposed a similar theory, this time including the photon as well as $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ bosons -- however they, too, relied on explicit symmetry breaking to provide a mass for the $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ bosons~\cite{Glashow1959,Glashow1961,SalamWard1964}.


With the development of the Higgs mechanism in 1964, which provided an indirect mechanism for gauge bosons to gain a non-zero mass spontaneously without the need to explicitly add a mass term~\cite{Higgs1964EnglertBrout,Higgs1964Higgs,Higgs1964GuralnikHagenKibble,BroutEnglertArXiv,guralnik2009}, it was perhaps only a matter of time before Salam and, separately, Steven Weinberg applied that mechanism to the weak force in 1967, producing a theory of electroweak interaction that was potentially renormalizable~\cite{Weinberg1967,salam1968}.~\aside{...and then Weinberg immediately went and predicted the masses of W and Z bosons.  Did he do a good job??}  It was not until 1971 that Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman proved that this class of theories actually \emph{is} renormalizable, thereby making the Weinberg-Salam model of the electroweak force a much more viable theory~\cite{thooftveltman1972}.

The Weinberg-Salam model of electroweak interactions was borne out by the experimental observation of the weak neutral current (i.e., the interaction mediated by the $Z^0$ boson) in 1973 at CERN's Gargamelle bubble chamber experiment~\cite{gargamelle}.  The $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ bosons themselves were first unambiguously observed at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron in 1983~\cite{UA1W,UA2W,UA1Z,UA2Z} --- with the $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ being quite massive in comparison to other fundamental particles, earlier experimental designs had not been powerful enough to reach the necessary energy scale.   \aside{Give the masses?  Maybe.}

Following the development of electroweak unification, 
%the complete Weinberg-Salam theory of electroweak interactions, 
theorists turned their attention to the nuclear strong force, which had been challenging to model in a mathematically rigorous way due to its property of growing \emph{stronger}, rather than weaker, at long distances.  The breakthrough came in 1973, when David Gross and Frank Wilczek, and separately, David Politzer developed a model of asymptotic freedom applied to the nuclear strong force~\cite{gross1973asymptotically,gross1973ultraviolet,politzer1973reliable}.  

The completed theories of electroweak and strong interactions, together, formed the core of what has come to be known as the standard model of particle physics.  It is unclear exactly when this terminology developed, or who originated it, but it had certianly come into use by the mid-1970s, and the usage still persists~\cite{PaisTreiman1975,weinberginterview2018}.  Notably, the only one of the fundamental forces not included under the umbrella of the standard model is the force of gravity, which is not compatible, as it is currently understood, with the quantum mechanical underpinnings of the standard model.  In the decades since, this incompatibility has been a major focus of inquiry for theoretical physicists, but the problem remains unresolved. 

\note[done]{Schwinger does renormalization, which makes QED go. Glashow~\cite{Glashow1959} extends it to the Z boson.  But now it's not renormalizable.  Salam and Ward~\cite{SalamWard1964} did a similar thing, but independently.   Then Weinberg (1967) did it but didn't know what to do with Z bosons~\cite{Weinberg1967}.  Until later.  Or something.  Then, 't Hooft (1971) proved that this thing was normalizable even with massive gauge bosons~\cite{thooft1971}.  Or at least, that's how Wikipedia describes it.  Also, in the end, electroweak unification was based on Yang-Mills (1954)~\cite{YangMills1954}, but their theory didn't really get that much attention initially because it was just a lot of boring math, and they couldn't figure out how to something something symmetry breaking.}

\section{Beta Decay within the Standard Model and \; \mbox{Beyond}}
\label{sec:SMandBeyond}
In the most general sense, the process of beta decay is one in which a nucleon (proton or neutron) is transformed into a different nucleon (i.e., a neutron or proton, respectively) and a beta particle (a positron or electron, respectively) and neutrino are emitted.

At the nucleon level, there are three basic classes of beta decay processes:
\bea
	  n \;\;\rightarrow& p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e        
\;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; 
	  & \beta^- \;\, \mathrm{Decay}    
\label{eq:betaminus_decay}  \\
	  p \;\;\rightarrow& n + e^+ + \nu_e              
\;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; 
	  & \beta^+ \;\, \mathrm{Decay}    
\label{eq:betaplus_decay}   \\
p + e^- \;\;\rightarrow& n + \nu_e, \;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; 
\;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; \;\;\;\; 
	   & \mathrm{Electron \;\, Capture}    
\label{eq:electroncapture}
\eea
where $p$ represents a proton and $n$ a neutron, $e^-$/$e^+$ represents an electron/positron (often referred to as a $\beta^-$/$\beta^+$), and $\nu_e$/$\bar{\nu}_e$ represents an electron neutrino/electron anti-neutrino.  In practice, these are often all simply referred to as "neutrinos".  

Of course, the processes of $\beta^+$ decay and electron capture are energetically disallowed for a proton not bound within a nucleus, but a free neutron will eventually undergo $\beta^-$ decay.  
%The rules for which of the above are energetically possible within a nucleus
Within the nucleus, rules of which processes are and are not energetically allowed are dependent on the specific nucleus in question.  Figure~\ref{fig:feynmandiagrams_betadecay} shows the Feynman diagrams associated with each of these processes.   
\begin{figure}[h!t!b!]

Energetic considerations aside, it is worthwhile to consider whether there might be any rules relating to the \emph{spin} of the nucleons before and after a decay, or the spins and angular correlations of the leptons that emerge.  Does the nucleon's spin flip during the decay process, or remain unchanged?  Are the decay products emitted preferentially in any particular direction?  Which direction are the beta and neutrino spins pointed in after they are emitted?  Angular momentum must, of course, be conserved -- but the question is \emph{how} it is to be conserved.  This question is not only at the heart of many modern precision measurements in beta decay physics, it has also been a driving force behind the development of much of our understanding of the nuclear weak force.

We must develop the tools with which these questions can be discussed.  We will begin by using Fermi's classic description of a beta decay as a transition that occurs with zero range:
\bea
\mathcal{M}_{fi} &=& G_F \int \bar{\psi}_f \, \mathcal{\hat{O}} \, \psi_i \,\textrm{d}V,
\label{eq:fermitransition}
\eea 
where $\mathcal{M}_{fi}$ is the transition matrix element between the final ($\psi_f$) and initial ($\psi_i$) states, and $G_F$ gives a measure of the strength of the coupling between states.  The integral is evaluated over phase space volume, and the operator $\mathcal{\hat{O}}$, which has yet to be determined, allows for a mathematical description of how the initial and final states must be related in order for a transition to occur.

Of course, this description represents a model of nuclear transitions which is highly simplified;  by neglecting the $W$ bosons that mediate the process and that we now know to be present, the result is a description of an interaction with zero range -- i.e., the leptons must be emitted from the exact place where the nucleon was transmuted.  Because the mediating $W$ bosons are so heavy ($m_W = 80.379(12)$\,GeV/$c^2$ ~\cite{pdg2018}), the range of the interaction is extremely limited, so the above turns out to be a very good description.  

This immediately gives rise to a rate law commonly known as Fermi's Golden Rule, 
\beq
\Gamma \;\; = \;\; \frac{1}{\tau}  \;\; = \;\; \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \left| \mathcal{M}_{fi} \right|^2 \, \rho(E_f),
\eeq
which describes the relationship between the total transition rate $\Gamma$ (or equivalently the lifetime $\tau$), the transition matrix element $\mathcal{M}_{fi}$, and the available density of states at the final energy, $\rho(E_f)$.  We can also use this to write down the differential decay rate, 
\bea
\frac{\textrm{d}^5 \Gamma}{ \textrm{d} \Ebeta \textrm{d}\Omegahatbeta \textrm{d} \Omegahatnu } 
&=& \frac{1}{(2\pi)^5} \, \pbeta \Ebeta (E_0 - \Ebeta)^2 \FFpm (\Ebeta, Z^\prime) \left| \mathcal{M}_{fi} \right|^2,
\label{eq:fermidifferentialdecayrate}
\eea
where \aside{pretty sure I lost an $\hbar$.  Maybe no one will notice.  }
$\Ebeta$ and $\pbeta$ are the outgoing $\beta$'s (total) energy and momentum,
$E_0$ is the maximum possible $\beta$ energy associated with the transition, 
and $\FFpm$ is called a Fermi function (with $Z^\prime$ the proton number of the daughter), and is used to account for the electric force between the nucleus and the (charged) outgoing electron (top) or positron (bottom)~\cite{Fermi1934Italian,Fermi1934German,krane}.  The $\textrm{d}\bf{\hat{\Omega}_{\beta/\nu}}$ terms refer to the infinitesimal solid angle element for the outgoing $\beta$ and $\nu$ particles.

With this description, the problem of characterizing the transition is reduced to determining the form of $\mathcal{\hat{O}}$.  %, or equivalently, $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}}$.  
Table~\ref{table:dirac_matrix_operators} provides a comprehensive list of all operators for which Lorentz invariance holds.  The complete transition operator $\mathcal{\hat{O}}$ must be comprised of a linear combination of these terms.  
\input{table_dirac_matrix_operators.tex} % table:dirac_matrix_operators


An equivalent expression for Eq.~(\ref{eq:fermitransition}) can be written in terms of the interaction Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}}$, as:
%, $\mathcal{M}_{fi}$ may be written in terms of the interaction Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}}$, as 
\bea
\mathcal{M}_{fi} &=& \int \! \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}} \, \textrm{d}V. 
\label{eq:transitionmatrixhamiltonian_intro}
\eea 

To obtain a full solution to the above, we will make use of the Lee-Yang interaction Hamiltonian, which provides a generalized combination of the Lorentz invariant operators and fits neatly into Eq.~(\ref{eq:transitionmatrixhamiltonian_intro})~\cite{LeeYang}:
%The Lee-Yang interaction Hamiltonian is: %\aside{It's an *interaction* Hamiltonian!}
\input{equation_LeeYangHamiltonian_intro.tex}%  \label{eq:lee_yang_hamiltonian_intro} 

Here, $C_X$ and $C_X^{\prime}$ (with $X=\{V,A,S,T,P\}$) are complex coupling constants for vector, axial, scalar, tensor, and pseudoscalar interactions, and $\psi_Y$ (with $Y=\{p,n,e,\nu\}$) are the wavefunctions for the interaction's proton, neutron, electron, and neutrino.  Operators $\gamma_5$ and $\gamma_\mu$ are Dirac gamma matrices, and $\mbox{$\sigma_{\lambda\mu} = -\frac{i}{2}(\gamma_\lambda \gamma_\mu - \gamma_\mu\gamma_\lambda )$}$.  As usual, ``H.C.'' represents the Hermitian conjugate of the previous terms within the Hamiltonian.

It can be seen from the form of the Hamiltonian that the $V,A,S,T,P$ couplings within are described as such because they \emph{behave} as vectors, axial-vectors, scalars, tensors, and pseudoscalars (respectively) under a Lorentz transform, where the Lagrangian itself must be a scalar both before and after a Lorentz transform~\cite{LeeYang,Falkowski2021,hong_sternberg_garcia}.

The fact that there are two coupling constants (primed and unprimed) for each type of coupling relates to the \emph{handedness} of the interaction.  Both left-handed and right-handed couplings, or a combination thereof, are \emph{a priori} possible, and the form of Eq.~\ref{eq:lee_yang_hamiltonian_intro} does not give preference to either.

While it is possible to define an interaction's handedness in a rigorous and mathematical way, the reader may gain more clarity by simply remembering the rule of thumb that a left-handed weak force 
% (which is predominantly or entirely what exists in nature) 
couples only to left-handed regular matter leptons and right-handed anti-leptons --- where the handedness of a lepton or other particle is defined by the direction of its spin relative to its direction of motion.  That description is exact in the limit where such a particle travels at the speed of light (otherwise a clever Lorentz transform can change the result), but the underlying mathematics is well defined for slower particles as well.  For neutrinos, which are so light they were long believed to be massless, the description is nearly perfect.  For electrons and positrons emitted in beta decay, which are massive but often emitted at relativistic speeds, the description is modified by inserting a factor of $v/c$ to quantify the handedness exactly.  
%is only \emph{pretty good}.  

\note{Here, we should put in Falkowski's convention to separate out the RH and LH components of things.  Or take it out completely.}

Over the years, we have collectively learned much about which simplifications to Eq.~\ref{eq:lee_yang_hamiltonian_intro} can be justified.  Typically, reference to the pseudoscalar couplings is one of the first things to be dropped, because it is suppressed at typical beta decay energies, and as such its presence would be difficult to demonstrate and have very little effect on experimental results.  
It is also now widely understood that 
the nuclear weak force involves primarily (or entirely) vector and axial vector couplings, and is primarily (or entirely) a left-handed interaction in which parity is maximally (or nearly maximally) violated.  

\note{We'll use Falkowski's convention to re-wite the Lee-Yang Hamiltonian in terms of right- and left-handed interactions.  That'll be useful later.  Sort-of.}

\note{Something about how beta decays turned out to be $(V-A)$...}

Although the physics community has largely come to a consensus 
%over the years 
on the \emph{dominant} behaviour of the nuclear weak force, there still exists a range of possible \emph{sub-dominant} behaviours that cannot be ruled out by theoretical considerations alone, and therefore must be tested experimentally.  With the weak force already so well described, searching for indications of unexpected behaviours is the domain of precision measurements.  This class of non-dominant behaviours is sometimes described as exotic physics, or with the imprecise label of physics \ac{BSM}, or even the wildly inaccurate misnomer, ``new physics''~\cite{Combs2020,GonzalesalonsoNaviliatcuncicSeverijns2019,newphysics_cirgiliano2019,newphysics_neutrinoless2015,newphysics_neutrinoless2007,newphysics_1998,newphysics_1992langacker}.  

Many types of exotic physics have, in fact, already been described by Lee and Yang's 1956 interaction Hamiltonian, which was originally motivated by the question of parity conservation within beta decay~\cite{LeeYang}.  Despite the original motivations, the authors were very thorough in their description of possible interaction types.  By starting with Fermi's contact interaction model of beta decay, incorporating Gamow and Teller's selection rules, and enforcing Lorentz invariance, they arrived at a nucleon-level Hamiltonian (quarks had not been discovered yet) which accounted for \emph{all} possible coupling behaviours~\cite{GamowTeller}. 

%\note[jbn]{John vetoes the following paragraph, which admittedly is stupid.}
%In the years since, we have discovered that beta decay is mediated by $W^\pm$ bosons, which, among other things, allows for the possibility of certain transitions (ie, with different selection rules) occuring, which had been considered forbidden under the contact interaction model.

\section{Our Decay}
Here, we will focus on the decay,
\bea
^{37}\textrm{K} &\rightarrow& \,^{37}\textrm{\!Ar} + \beta^{+} + \nu_e, 
\label{eq:ourdecay}
\eea
which is extremely well suited to the type of experiment to be the discussed in this thesis.  
%this and other similar experiments -- both because of its suitability 
The parent, $^{37}\textrm{K}$, is an isotope of potassium---an alkali.  Though this fact may initially seem unremarkable, it is their hydrogen-like~\aside[done, nolist]{hydrogen-like does not need quotes} single valence electron which allows alkalis to be readily trapped within a magneto-optical trap, a critical component of our experimental design (see Chapter~\ref{atomicphysics_chapter}).

A potential concern in any experiment concerned with the angular correlations resulting from one particular decay branch is the background from competing decay branches.  As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:nuclearleveldiagram}, the decay of $^{37}\textrm{K}$ is dominated by a single branch which contributes nearly $98\%$ of $^{37}\textrm{K}$ decay events, and the remaining events nearly all arise from a single branch contributing around $2\%$ of the decay events.  The other branches combined account for only around $0.04\%$ of decays.  Taken all together, this means that the background events which must be accounted for are both infrequent and well understood.

As in any decay, the angular correlations between the emerging daughter particles provide a rich source of information about the type of interaction that produced the decay.  
This particular decay involves a set of isobaric mirror nuclei, meaning that the nuclear wavefunctions of the parent and daughter are identical up to their isospin quantum number and corresponding electrical charge.  Because the two wavefunctions are so similar, effects to the decay from nuclear structure corrections are well understood and can be kept to a minimum, making it possible to place especially strong constraints on the size of the theoretical uncertainties associated with the decay.

\section{The Physical Signature of the Fierz Interference}
%\subsection{Mathematical Description}
\label{sec:mathdescription_intro}
In this section, we consider how scalar and tensor interactions within the beta decay process might manifest as a physical observable.  As this section is, in part, intended to aid the reader in gaining a physical intuition for certain aspects of decay behaviour, only the leading order terms are described. However, the full mathematical formalism including many higher-order terms is worked out in detail within Appendix~\ref{appendix_forthepeople}.
%this section will simply provide the result directly, and use this as a starting point. 
The \ac{PDF} below provides a description of beta decay in terms of the outgoing beta's energy and direction relative to the nuclear spin, in terms of (almost) all mathematically consistent types of couplings. (Pseudoscalar couplings are neglected in this treatment, because they are relativistically suppressed at the energy scales characteristic of typical beta decays.)  This \ac{PDF} is a simplification of the one presented in the classic \ac{JTW} paper, and is accurate to leading order~\cite{jtw,jtw_coulomb,EbelFeldman1957}.  For the dominant branch of $^{37}$K decay, we have:
%This two-dimensional \ac{PDF} provides a description of beta decay in terms of the outgoing beta's energy and direction relative to the nuclear spin
%%To leading order, the probability density function from the classic \ac{JTW} paper can be used to describe beta decay in terms of the outgoing beta's energy and direction relative to the nuclear spin~\cite{jtw,jtw_coulomb,EbelFeldman1957}.  
\bea
	\textrm{d}^2 \Gamma  ( \Ebeta, \theta ) 
	&=&
	W(\Ebeta) \left[ 1 + \bFierz \frac{\m c^2}{\Ebeta} + \Abeta \, \frac{\pe c }{\Ee}\, |\vecP| \cos\theta  \right] \, \dEe \, \textrm{d} \theta , 
\nonumber \\
\label{equation:integrated_jtw_INTRODUCTION}
\eea
where $\vecP$ is the overall nuclear spin polarization, $\Ee$ and $\pe$ are the energy and momentum of the outgoing beta particle, and $\theta$ is the angle between $\vecP$ and the beta emission direction.  
As usual, $\me$ is the mass of the electron and $c$ is the speed of light.
The expression's overall energy dependence has been absorbed into the term $W(\Ebeta)$, so that
\bea
W(\Ebeta) &:=& \frac{2}{(2\pi)^3} \, \FFminus \, \xi \, \pe \Ee (E_0 - \Ee)^2,
\label{eq:overallenergydependence_intro}
\eea
where $E_0$ is the maximum possible beta energy associated with the transition.  The function $\FFminus$ is a Fermi function for outgoing positrons,
%for outgoing electrons (top) and positrons (bottom), 
with $Z^\prime$ the proton number of the daughter nucleus.  The Fermi function accounts for the force from the electric charge of the daughter nucleus and its orbital electrons acting on the outgoing electron/positron.  It is computed with the Dirac equation using various levels of approximation to describe the nuclear charge distribution and screening of that charge distribution by electrons near the nucleus.
\aside{cite:  Hayen+Severijns et.al., 2017.}

We now turn our attention to the parameters $\Abeta$ (the beta asymmetry), $\bFierz$ (the Fierz interference), and $\xi$ that are used in Eqs.~(\ref{equation:integrated_jtw_INTRODUCTION})-(\ref{eq:overallenergydependence_intro}).  These parameters are unique to the transition under consideration, but are nevertheless closely related to certain universally applicable coupling strengths.  They can be written in terms of the universally applicable complex coupling constants $C_X$ and $C_X^{\prime}$ of Eq.~(\ref{eq:lee_yang_hamiltonian_intro})
%(with $X=\{V,A,S,T,P\}$) are complex coupling constants for vector, axial, scalar, tensor, and pseudoscalar interactions
as follows: 
\input{equations_jtw_params_onlyintegrated_intro}

In the above expressions, $M_F$ and $M_{GT}$ are the Fermi (vector coupling) and Gamow-Teller (axial coupling) matrix elements unique to a particular transition,~\aside[note]{See Appendix~\ref{sec:jtw_formalism}, I guess?} and 
\\
\mbox{$\gamma := \left( 1-\alpha^2 Z^{\prime 2} \right)^{1/2} \approx 1$}, using fine structure constant $\alpha$.
%\note[note,nolist]{}
\aside[note]{I've specialized to the 98\% branch already.  Did I say so?}

The expressions above have many free parameters, and some simplifications and assumptions must be made before any experimental measurement can be interpreted in a physically meaningful way.  
%a physically meaningful measurement can be made.  
We note that each type of interaction $X$ (for $X=\{V,A,S,T\}$) is described by \emph{two} complex coupling constants, $C_X$ and $C_X^\prime$;  this extra degree of freedom is necessary in order to describe couplings to both left-handed and right-handed helicity leptons.
~\aside{Is it definitely helicity?  Or do I mean chirality?  I think helicity is right.  probably.}
In practice, we already know that the weak force couples (almost) entirely to left-handed electrons and right-handed positrons.  Separately, we know that the interaction proceeds (almost) entirely by vector and axial couplings.  Taken together, this suggests that neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, as leptons, must (predominantly) follow the same helicity selection rules that apply to electrons and positrons.  This is because, \emph{e.g.}, a decay mediated by either scalar or tensor couplings would produce two outgoing leptons/anti-leptons of the \emph{same} helicity.  

It is this subtlety which gives rise to the energy dependence ($\me c^2 / \Ee $) by which $\bFierz$ is multiplied in Eq.~(\ref{equation:integrated_jtw_INTRODUCTION}).  
%--- it is fundamentally an \emph{interference} term between the interactions of standard model physics with an unknown exotic physics term.  
That is, if we have restricted ourselves to interactions involving right-handed anti-neutrinos travelling at the speed of light, then the scalar or tensor components of this interaction, if present, must also couple to right-handed helicity electrons.  The lower the energy of the outgoing electron, the greater the fraction of available phase space in which the electron appears to be right-handed from the reference frame of the mediating $W$-boson.  In other words, this term describes a mechanism by which scalar and tensor couplings can effectively compete with the expected vector and axial couplings~\cite{hong_sternberg_garcia,Greiner2009}.
%;  this is why $\bFierz$ is described as an \emph{interference} term~\cite{hong_sternberg_garcia,Greiner2009}.
% effectively competing with the expected vector and axial couplings.  

As a practical matter, the ($\me c^2 / \Ee $) dependence of the Fierz term suggests that $\bFierz$ is best measured by a relatively low-energy experiment (such as the one described here) in order to maximize sensitivity;  a high-energy experiment would have trouble constraining it.

So you get a factor of electron mass in there.

We will henceforth take $C_X = C_X^\prime$, which is equivalent to a requirement that all couplings are left-handed.  We define a set of purely left-handed couplings:
\bea
g_V &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}  \, (C_V + C_V^\prime )  %\;\; = \;\; +\, 1.0
\label{eq:gV_def}
\\
g_A &=& \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \, (C_A + C_A^\prime )  %\;\; \approx \;\; +\, 0.91210
\label{eq:gA_def}
\\
g_S &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, (C_S + C_S^\prime ) 
\label{eq:gS_def}
\\
g_T &=& \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \, (C_T + C_T^\prime).
\label{eq:gT_def}
\eea
Furthermore, we will also require going forward that all $C_X$ must be \emph{real};  this is equivalent to requiring that the interactions obey time-reversal invariance. 
%\note[note,nolist]{}
%If one assumes the standard model holds, $\Abeta$, $\bFierz$, and $\xi$ can be written in terms of a greatly simplified set of parameters.  
We also introduce $\rho$, the ratio of Gamow-Teller and Fermi couplings:  %$\rho$ is unique to a particular transition, and must be measured experimentally.  
\bea
\rho &:=& \frac{C_A M_{GT}}{C_V M_F}  \;\; = \;\; \frac{- g_A M_{GT}}{g_V M_F}.
\label{eq:definerho_intro}
\eea
The value of $\rho$ is unique to a particular transition, and must be extracted experimentally (see Sec.~\ref{sec:extractinglambda}).
~\aside[note]{See Appendix~\ref{sec:combo_formalism} for a discussion of the relationship between parameters $C_X$ and $g_X$.  I guess.}  

Using the above notation and the simplifying assumptions that give rise it, and dropping terms of order (small)$^2$ or higher, it is possible to re-write Eqs.~(\ref{eq:jtw_xi_integrated_intro})-(\ref{eq:jtw_Abetaxi_integrated_intro}) as:

\bea
\xi &=& 2 \,\, C_V^2 \, | M_F |^2 \left( 1 + \rho^2 \right)
\label{eq:xiwithrho_intro} 
\\
\bFierz &=& \frac{-2\gamma}{1 + \rho^2} \left( \frac{g_S}{g_V} + \rho^2 \frac{g_T}{g_A} \right). 
\label{bFierzwithlambda}
\\
\Abeta &=& \frac{\frac{2}{5} \rho^2 - 2 \rho \sqrt{\frac{3}{5}}  }{1 + \rho^2},
\label{eq:Awithrho_intro}
\eea
where $\bFierz$ reduces to 0 in the standard model limit where $g_S = g_T = 0$.  Notably, $\bFierz$ is the only term within our beta decay \ac{PDF} which includes (small) exotic couplings at the \emph{linear} order;  $g_S$ and $g_T$ arise only at quadratic order within the other terms, and thus have been dropped from Eqs.~(\ref{eq:xiwithrho_intro}) and (\ref{eq:Awithrho_intro}) above.

Because the nucleus is significantly more massive than either of the other two outgoing particles, the great majority of the released kinetic energy is distributed between the leptons, while the nucleus receives only a tiny fraction of the total.

%In order to proceed with a measurement, we must find an equation to describe the probability of beta decay events with any given distribution of energy and momenta among the daughter particles, as a function of the strength of the specific couplings of interest to us.

%which describes the effects of all types of Standard Model and exotic couplings of interest to us here, but which truncates its expression at first order in the (small) parameter of transferred nuclear recoil energy, and a newer formalism from Holstein~\cite{holstein}, which includes terms up to several orders higher in recoil energy, but which does not include any description of the exotic couplings of particular interest to us.

\section{The Superratio}
\label{signature_chapter}
In considering Eqs.~(\ref{equation:integrated_jtw_INTRODUCTION})-(\ref{eq:overallenergydependence_intro}), we see that the $\bFierz$ term includes an explicit energy dependence.  From this, it seems natural to conclude that the shape of the beta energy spectrum can be used to measure the value of $\bFierz$.  This assertion is correct as far as it goes --- but a direct measurement of the complete energy spectrum is arguably not the best way to approach the matter.  In fact, it is possible to extract a much clearer signal to measure both $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$ by making some clever choices in how our data should be processed.  
To see this, it is helpful to consider the $\Abeta$ term within Eq.~(\ref{equation:integrated_jtw_INTRODUCTION}), which carries an explicit angular dependence as well as its own explicit energy dependence.  

Through a judicious choice of detector placements, it is possible to measure the beta energy spectrum at its angular extrema, with $\cos\theta \approx \pm 1$ (recall that $\theta$ is defined to be the angle between direction of nuclear polarization and beta emission).  
\aside{Of course, the $\Abeta$ term vanishes for decays from spin-zero nuclei.}  
With differing contributions to each angle-selected beta spectrum from the $\Abeta$ term (and no other angular dependence), it is clear that any nonzero $\bFierz$ term must provide a different \emph{fractional} contribution to the full spectrum as a function of angle.
%\aside{Recall that this is angle between polarization and emission.}  

One way to quantify this fractional difference might be to take a simple ratio of the two spectra, evaluated at each energy bin --- however the effect of a non-zero $\bFierz$ term would be quite small in comparison with the overarching angular dependence of $\Abeta$.  Indeed, with the observed beta spectra explicitly selected according to emission angle, it makes little sense to attempt to extract a measurement of $\bFierz$ without a simultaneous measurement of $\Abeta$.  With this caveat kept in mind, we will now work towards finding an expression for $\Abeta$ in terms of experimental observables, with the understanding that an expression for $\bFierz$ will follow naturally.  
%--- however we will soon see that we can do better than this.  

We will approach the problem by first separating beta energy spectral data into categories relating to the angular dependence of an individual event with respect to the direction of nuclear spin.  % (which parameterizes the $\Abeta$ observable).  
If, as in our case, sets of data can be further subdivided into categories that can be expected to measure similar physical behaviours, but which may have differing systematic effects, it is possible to force many of these these systematic effects to cancel out at leading order, as we will soon see.  

%For example, in our case, the nuclear polarization is flipped periodically within a (mostly) symmetric apparatus, with beta detectors above and below along the axis of polarization.  
%
For example, within the \ac{TRINAT} experimental setup, the polarization is flipped periodically between two states (+/-), within a (mostly) symmetric apparatus.  Two similar beta detectors (T/B) are positioned opposite one another along the vertical axis of polarization at the top and bottom of the experimental chamber (see Chapter~\ref{experimental_chapter}).  Then, with two detectors and two polarization states, we can describe four different experimental count rates based on Eq.~(\ref{equation:integrated_jtw_INTRODUCTION}).  Neglecting scattering effects, we have:
\bea
\!\! \!\!
r_{\mathrm T+}(\Ebeta) &=& W(\Ebeta)\, \varepsilon_{\mathrm T}(\Ebeta)\, \Omega_{\mathrm T} \, N_+ \left[1 + \bFierz \frac{\m c^2}{\Ebeta}  + \Abeta \, \frac{v}{c} |\vecP_{\bm{+}}| \langle \cos\theta \rangle_{\mathrm T+} \right] \;\;\;  \label{eq:r1} \\

\eea
%
where the $\varepsilon_{\mathrm T / \mathrm B}(\Ebeta)$ are the (top/bottom) detector efficiencies, $\Omega_{\mathrm T / \mathrm B}$ are the fractional solid angles from the trap position to the (top/bottom) detector from the trap position, $N_{+/-}$ are the number of atoms trapped in each (+/-) polarization state, and $|\vecP_{\bm{+/-}}|$ are the magnitudes of the polarization along the detector axis for each polarization state.  $\langle \cos\theta \rangle_{\mathrm T/ \mathrm B, +/-} $ is the average of $\cos\theta$ for \emph{observed} outgoing betas, 
%(\emph{i.e.}, observed in a detector with $\cos\theta \approx \pm 1$ in the present experiment), 
for each detector and polarization state combination.  This latter term is approximately $\pm 1$ as a result of our detector geometry, but contains important sign information.

Recalling the form of the overall energy dependence $W(\Ebeta)$ from Eq.~(\ref{eq:overallenergydependence_intro}), we note that the presence of the Fermi function $\FFminus$ at any reasonable level of approximation makes $W(\Ebeta)$ integrable only by numerical methods.  As a result, there is little that could be changed to make the expression more difficult to work with, so we can safely take $W(\Ebeta)$ to be an arbitrary function.  Therefore, for the remainder of this section, we will take $W(\Ebeta)$ to implicitly include the small corrections to overall energy dependence that arise from \emph{e.g.}\! recoil-order corrections, as described by Holstein~\cite{holstein}.


These four beta spectra can be used to construct the so-called superratio and superratio asymmetry, both of which have some very useful properties.  The latter of these is the measure that will eventually be used to extract the values of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$.   

We define the superratio, $s$, as:
\bea
s \;\;=\;\; s(\Ebeta) \;\;:=\;\; \frac{ r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+} }{ r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-} } , 
\eea
and the superratio asymmetry, $A_{\mathrm{super}}$, as:
\bea
A_{\mathrm{super}} \;\;=\;\; A_{\mathrm{super}}(\Ebeta) &:=& \frac{1-\sqrt{s}}{1+\sqrt{s}} 
\\
&=& \frac{ \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-} \phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) } }\; -\, \sqrt{ r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+}\phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} }{ \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-}\phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} \;+\, \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+} \phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} }.
\eea
%
\note[oldnote, nolist]{We used to have:  $s := \frac{ r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-} }{ r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+} }$, and the $A_{\mathrm{super}}$ that follows.  But that's wrong.  :(   Need $s > 1$ to get the right result.}

This is explicitly an experimental quantity that is measured directly by the above combination of count rates, however it is obvious that it reduces, under appropriate limits, to be equivalent to a naive asymmetry.  In particular, if we require that the physical conditions and relative detector positions and sensitivities are identical when the polarization is flipped, then we have $r_{\mathrm T+}(\Ebeta) = r_{\mathrm B-}(\Ebeta)$, $r_{\mathrm T-}(\Ebeta) = r_{\mathrm B+}(\Ebeta)$, and $|\vecP_{\bm{+}}| = |\vecP_{\bm{-}}|$.
%
With these simplifying assumptions, the superratio asymmetry quickly reduces into a more intuitive quantity that we might use for a measurement with only a single polarization state, e.g.,  
%%\bea
%%A_{\mathrm{super}} &\rightarrow& \frac{ r_{\mathrm T+}\, - \,r_{\mathrm B+} }{r_{\mathrm T+}\, +\, r_{\mathrm B+} } 
%%\;\;\; \rightarrow \;\;\; \Abeta \frac{v}{c} |\vecP| .

\label{eq:singlepol_asymmetry}
\eea
%\note{Assumes $\bFierz=0$.  Or, rather, we can only interpret it as $\Abeta$ if $\bFierz=0$.  }

The superratio, and superratio asymmetry, has been used for precision beta decay measurements in the past to measure the neutron's beta asymmetry~\cite{UCNA_first_superratio}, and our own collaboration has also used it to measure the beta asymmetry in $^{37}$K~\cite{ben_Abeta}.  More recently, it has been used to measure the neutron's Fierz interference term~\cite{UCNAfierz2020,Saul2020} as well, with notably more impressive results than using the earlier `supersum' data combination method~\cite{UCNA_first_Fierz}.  


%%%\note{}
%%%In the case of the present experiment, we note that $|\vec{P}_+| = |\vec{P}_-|$ is correct to a high degree of precision.
%%%\note{}



While Eq.~(\ref{eq:singlepol_asymmetry}) is conceptually encouraging, the assumptions that gave rise to it are too simplifying.  
%
Fortunately, as we'll soon see, the key to the effectiveness of the superratio technique is that many systematic effects can be made to cancel at the leading order, at the cost of some statistical resolving power.  
%
We will introduce some less restrictive assumptions for what follows, along with shorthand notation for improved readability (and to make it obvious which quantities are to be considered small).  First, we require that the magnitude of the polarization vector is the same for both polarization states (within the present experiment, $|\vecP_{\bm +}| = |\vecP_{\bm -}|$ is correct to a high degree of precision), and also that the average of the magnitude of $\cos\theta$ for a given detector does not change when the polarization is flipped (equivalent to a requirement that the trap position doesn't change when the polarization is flipped).  Then: 
\bea
P &:=& |\vecP_{\bm +}| = |\vecP_{\bm -}|  \\
\langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_T &:=& \langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_{\mathrm T+} \, = \, \langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_{\mathrm T-} \\
\langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_B &:=& \langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_{\mathrm B+} \, = \, \langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_{\mathrm B-},
\eea
and we can further define
\bea
c &=& \,\,\,\,\, \langle | \cos\theta | \rangle :=  \frac{1}{2} \left( \phantom{2_2^2}\!\!\!\! \langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_T + \langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_B \, \right) \\
\Delta c &=& \Delta \langle | \cos\theta | \rangle := \frac{1}{2} \left( \phantom{2_2^2}\!\!\!\! \langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_T - \langle |\cos\theta | \rangle_B \, \right)
\eea
and 
\bea
\tilde{A} &=\;\; \tilde{A}(\Ebeta) &:=\;\; A_\beta \frac{v}{c} \\ 
\tilde{b} &=\;\; \tilde{b}(\Ebeta) &:=\;\;  \bFierz \frac{mc^2}{\Ebeta}, \\
\tilde{r} &=\;\; \tilde{r}(\Ebeta) &:=\;\; 1+\tilde{b}. 
\eea

With this new set of variables defined, we can re-write Eqs.~(\ref{eq:r1}-\ref{eq:r4}) as
\bea
r_{\mathrm T+}(\Ebeta) &=& W(\Ebeta)\, \varepsilon_{\mathrm T}(\Ebeta)\, \Omega_{\mathrm T}\, N_+ \left[\tilde{r}  \,+\, \tilde{A} P \left( \phantom{2_2^2}\!\!\!\! c + \Delta c \, \right) \right] \\
r_{\mathrm B+}(\Ebeta) &=& W(\Ebeta)\, \varepsilon_{\mathrm B}(\Ebeta)\, \Omega_{\mathrm B}\, N_+ \left[\tilde{r}  \,-\, \tilde{A} P \left( \phantom{2_2^2}\!\!\!\! c - \Delta c \, \right) \right] \\
r_{\mathrm T-}(\Ebeta) &=& W(\Ebeta)\, \varepsilon_{\mathrm T}(\Ebeta)\, \Omega_{\mathrm T}\, N_- \left[\tilde{r}  \,-\, \tilde{A} P \left( \phantom{2_2^2}\!\!\!\! c + \Delta c \, \right) \right] \\
r_{\mathrm B-}(\Ebeta) &=& W(\Ebeta)\, \varepsilon_{\mathrm B}(\Ebeta)\, \Omega_{\mathrm B}\, N_- \left[\tilde{r}  \,+\, \tilde{A} P \left( \phantom{2_2^2}\!\!\!\! c - \Delta c \, \right) \right], 
\eea
and the superratio becomes
\bea
s 
&=& 
\frac{ 
\left(
\tilde{r} + \tilde{A} P c \right)^2 -  \left( \phantom{\tilde{2}_2^2}\!\!\!\!\! \Delta c \right)^2 
}{ 
\left(
\tilde{r} - \tilde{A} P c \right)^2 -  \left( \phantom{\tilde{2}_2^2}\!\!\!\!\! \Delta c \right)^2 
} 
\eea
where all factors of $W(\Ebeta)$, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm T/B}(\Ebeta)$, $\Omega_{\mathrm T/B}$, and $N_{+/-}$ have been cancelled out entirely.  

For simplicity we take $\Delta c = 0$ in what follows.  Although this is not strictly accurate within the present experiment, this assumption greatly simplifies the expressions that follow.  Then, absent other corrections (\emph{e.g.} backscattering, unpolarized background, ...), it is clear that if $\tilde{b} = 0$ as in the Standard Model, %it follows that 
\bea
A_{\mathrm{super}} &=\;\; \tilde{A} P c &=\;\; \Abeta \, \frac{v}{c} \, |\vec{P}| \, \langle | \cos\theta | \rangle
\eea

In the case where $\tilde{b} \neq 0$, we find that 
\bea
A_{\mathrm{super}} &=& \frac{\tilde{A} P c}{1+\tilde{b}} \\
&\approx&  \tilde{A} P c \, (1 - \tilde{b} + {\tilde{b}}^2),
\eea
where we have utilized the assumption that $\tilde{b} \ll 1$.
Thus, to leading order in terms of $\tilde{b}$, 
\bea
A_{\mathrm{super}} &\approx& \Abeta \, \frac{v}{c} \, |\vec{P}| \, \langle | \cos\theta | \rangle \left( 1 - \bFierz \frac{mc^2}{\Ebeta} \right).
\eea


In addition to eliminating systematic effects, the superratio asymmetry also provides an enhanced signal to be evaluated, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:FierzSignature}.  The price for this clear signal and reduction in systematics is, unfortunately, a decrease in overall statistical resolving power.  Given the difficulty of controlling many of the cancelled systematics, this can potentially be a very good trade-off.

There are some limitations to what the superratio technique is able to deal with effectively, however --- notably, scattering effects don't cancel out particularly well.  Within the present project, this is a major systematic.  

Scattering, unpolarized background, \emph{and} the variety of effects effectively addressed by the superratio asymmetry construction are all included within the simulations to which the experimental data is compared, and the effects are propagated through the analysis to the end;  although many systematic effects can be reduced by the technique described above, they must still be evaluated.

%\note[oldnote,nolist]{}
%In the TRINAT geometry with two polarization states (+/-) and two nearly equivalent detectors (T/B) aligned along the axis of polarization, we are able to describe four different count rates, with different combinations of polarization states and detectors.  Thus, neglecting beta scattering effects, we have:

%It is this latter observation which motivates the construction of the superratio and superratio asymmetry as new observables comprised of a combination of multiple physical measurements at the angular extrema of beta emission.  
%\note{
%In fact, it is possible to extract a much clearer signal to measure both $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$ by making some clever choices in how our data should be processed.  
%}
%A further benefit to using the superratio construction, as we will soon see, is the cancellation (to first order) of many systematic effects.  The ``price'' for this reduction in systematics is, unfortunately, a decrease in statistical resolving power.  
%
%In fact, it is possible to extract a much clearer signal if we are clever with our choice of measurement.  To see this, it is helpful to notice that the \emph{overall} size of the $\bFierz$ term does not vary as a function of beta emission angle -- however, the $\Abeta$ term \emph{does}.  Indeed, in some sense, $\Abeta$ can be thought of as a parameterization of the extent to which the number of beta emissions changes as a function of angle.  
%
%The fact that we have in $\bFierz$ a small (or nonexistent), unchanging (with respect to angle) effect to be compared against a ``background'' large $\Abeta$ term which \emph{does} scale with emission angle, hints at a potential handle we might use to measure $\bFierz$ --- as we vary the emission angle under consideration, the \emph{fractional} size of the effect we're looking for will change!



\note[note,nolist]{}
%We now attempt to develop a physical intuition for the behaviour described above.  Considering Eq.~\ref{equation:integrated_jtw_INTRODUCTION}, we see that there is a beta energy dependence multiplying the $\bFierz$ term within the complete energy spectrum.  
%From this, it seems natural to assert that the most \emph{obvious} physically observable change that arises from the presence of a scalar or tensor coupling should be a change to the overall shape of the beta energy spectrum.  



%One way to do this is to separate the data into categories relating to their angular dependence with respect to the direction of nuclear spin (which parameterizes the $\Abeta$ observable).  If, as in our case, these sets of data can be further subdivided into categories that can be expected to have similar physical behaviours, but which may have differing systematic effects, the result is even more powerful.  In our case, the nuclear polarization is flipped periodically within a (mostly) symmetric apparatus, with beta detectors above and below along the axis of polarization.  The four beta spectra that result from this categorization can be used to construct a so-called superratio asymmetry.   


%The mathematical details of the superratio construction and its results are discussed in detail within Section~\ref{appendix:superratio}, so within the present section we will limit ourselves to a discussion of the results.

\note[done,nolist]{Here's where Juliette thinks I need to discuss the superratio harder.  ``On page 20, the details of the superratio construction are also relegated to an appendix''}

%%%%With the four rate spectra, $r_{D P}(\Ebeta)$, describing the rate at which events are detected in beta detector $D$ ($D =\{ \mathrm{T, B}  \}$ are the top and bottom detectors) from a decay whose parent had polarization $P$ (with $P=\{+,-\}$), we can construct the superratio asymmetry observable, $A_{\mathrm{super}}$, such that
%%%%\bea
%%%%A_{\mathrm{super}} \;\;=\;\; A_{\mathrm{super}}(\Ebeta) 
%%%%&=& \frac{ \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+} \phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) } }\; -\, \sqrt{ r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-}\phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} }{ \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+}\phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} \;+\, \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-} \phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} },
%%%%\eea

%%%%where $v$ is the speed of the emitted beta particle, $c$ is the speed of light, $m$ is the mass of the electron, $\Ebeta$ is the total beta energy, $\vec{P}$ gives the nuclear spin-polarization vector of the parent, and $\theta$ describes the angle between the polarization vector and the direction into which the beta is emitted.  The ensemble averaged term, $\langle | \cos\theta | \rangle$, is averaged over the betas that are observed in a \emph{detector} (located along the axis of polarization).

%The superratio and superratio asymmetry are discussed in detail within Section~\ref{appendix:superratio}.  The discussion includes details on which sort of systematic errors will cancel out entirely, or to leading order, with this treatment -- however 

%%It must be noted that for the present project, higher-order corrections are included in all simulations, and the effects are propagated through to the end of the analysis.  Though many systematic effects can be reduced by using the superratio asymmetry, they must still be evaluated.

\note{The point is, the presence of either scalar or tensor interactions will produce a $\bFierz$ term in the decay PDF.  It has other effects on the PDF, but those come in at higher-order in the tiny scalar and tensor couplings.  So, the Fierz term would be by far the biggest thing that changes in the PDF.  The PDF describes the energy and momentum of the outgoing beta w.r.t. a variety of other things.  Notably, we can write an elegant-ish description of beta momentum w.r.t. nuclear polarization direction, and ignore the neutrino completely after integrating over it.  We have a PDF in beta \emph{direction} (w.r.t. polarization), and beta \emph{energy}.  To lowest order (and lowest order is best order) the distribution w.r.t. polarization direction doesn't change, but the distribution w.r.t. energy does change.  Or ... something?  The point is, it makes a change in the beta energy spectrum.  This change is most pronounced at low energies, because the Fierz term is scaled by $(1/\Ebeta)$.  However, the asymmetry is also a function of $\Ebeta$.  A different function of $\Ebeta$.  In fact, it is scaled by $(\pbeta/\Ebeta)$ within the PDF, which is distinctly different than $\bFierz$.  So, one might ask what effect a $\bFierz$ term would produce on a constructed asymmetry spectrum.  ....This explanation has gone way off track.}

%%%%In the TRINAT geometry with two polarization states (+/-) and two nearly equivalent detectors (T/B) aligned along the axis of polarization, we are able to describe four different count rates, with different combinations of polarization states and detectors.

%%%%\eea
%%%%where $\varepsilon_{\mathrm T / \mathrm B}(\Ebeta)$ are the (top/bottom) detector efficiencies, $\Omega_{\mathrm T / \mathrm B}$ are the fractional solid angles for the (top/bottom) detector from the trap position, $N_{+/-}$ are the number of atoms trapped in each (+/-) polarization state, and $|\vec{P}_{+/-}|$ are the magnitudes of the polarization along the detector axis for each polarization state.  $\langle \cos\theta \rangle_{\mathrm T/ \mathrm B, +/-} $ is the average of $\cos\theta$ for \emph{observed} outgoing betas, for each detector and polarization state combination.  This latter term is approximately $\pm 1$ as a result of our detector geometry, but contains important sign information.  




%We define the superratio, $s$, to be:
%\bea
%s \;\;=\;\; s(\Ebeta) \;\;:=\;\; \frac{ r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-} }{ r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+} },

%\eea
%%
%This is explicitly an experimental quantity that is measured directly by the above combination of count rates, however it is obvious that it reduces, under appropriate limits, to be equivalent to a naive asymmetry.  In particular, if we require that the physical conditions and relative detector positions and sensitivities are identical when the polarization is flipped, then we have $r_{\mathrm T+}(\Ebeta) = r_{\mathrm B-}(\Ebeta)$ and $r_{\mathrm T-}(\Ebeta) = r_{\mathrm B+}(\Ebeta)$.
%%
%It follows that we can simplify the superratio asymmetry into a more intuitive quantity that we might use for a measurement with only a single polarization state, e.g.,

\section{The Gamow-Teller/Fermi Mixing Ratio and Related Constraints}
\label{sec:extractinglambda}
It is clear from Sec.~\ref{sec:mathdescription_intro} that in order to make a prediction about the behaviour of outgoing particles within a particular beta decay transition, it is fundamentally important to know the value of the mixing ratio $\rho$.

Of course, it is possible to perform a relatively direct measurement of $\rho$ through an observation of one of the other \ac{JTW} parameters (e.g., a measurement of $\Abeta$ in combination with Eq.~(\ref{eq:Awithrho_intro}) rapidly leads to a value for $\rho$.).  However, this strategy has certain drawbacks -- notably, the apparatus required to perform such a measurement \emph{well} must be fairly complex;  the TRINAT setup, for example, cannot readily be used with isotopes of most chemical elements.  

For $^{37}$K in particular, this direct approach \emph{has} been used in the past, both with the present dataset as well as with previously collected data, yielding an overall value of $\rho=0.576 \pm 0.006$~\cite{ben_Abeta,shidling2014,dan_Bnu}.

As we do not wish to re-use the same data twice within a single measurement, we take as our baseline the value of $\rho$ as extracted in a more roundabout way as described below.


It is useful to define the strength, $ft$, of a transition --- also known as the $ft$ value.  This is fundamentally an experimental quantity.  Though the $ft$ value is in principle the product of two quantities --- the statistical rate function $f$ and the partial half-life $t$ --- it is common to treat the product as a single unit.  
%The $ft$ value then can be directly related to the fundamental vector coupling strength.  
%
The statistical rate function $f$ must be split into vector and axial components ($f_V$ and $f_A$) in order be evaluated, and $f_V$ in particular is often used alone, as we will see below.  The statistical rate functions are, in essence, integrals over the accessible lepton phase space, and both $f_V$ and $f_A$ are mathematically non-trivial objects~\cite{towner_hardy_1995_frombook,HardyTowner2005_Superallowed}, but can be evaluated by, e.g., the methods of Refs.~\cite{wilkinson2,wilkinson3,wilkinson4}.  
%Both vector and axial statistical rate functions are mathematically non-trivial objects\cite{towner_hardy_1995_frombook,HardyTowner2005_Superallowed}, but can be evaluated by, e.g., the methods of Refs.~\cite{wilkinson2,wilkinson3,wilkinson4}.  
Such calculations are beyond the scope of the present work, however we will note that 
%For our purposes here, we will simply note that 
$f_V$ and $f_A$ are characterized primarily by the beta endpoint energy $E_0$ (scaling as $\sim E_0^5$), a quantity which can readily be measured.\aside[note]{John said this.  But I should probably cite someone here.}  

The partial half-life $t$ can be quickly calculated given knowledge of the total half-life $t_{1/2}$ and branching ratio $R$, as:
\bea
t &=&  \frac{1}{R} \, (1 + P_{\mathrm{EC}}) \,\, t_{1/2}, 
\eea
where $P_{\mathrm{EC}}$ is the electron capture probability (in the case of $^{37}$K, $P_{\mathrm{EC}}=0.0008$ makes only a small contribution~\cite{SeverijnsTandecki2008}).  
\aside{could also cite Severijns2008's Refs. 35 and 36...}  
It is also possible to write down an expression for $t$ based on something closer to a first principles approach:  
%,  including corrections arising from a variety of physical effects:
\bea
t &=& \frac{K}{ G_F^2 \, V_{ud}^2  \left( f_V\, C_V^2 |M_F|^2 + f_A\, C_A^2 |M_{GT}|^2 
%\phantom{\frac{1^1_1}{1^1_1} \!\!\!\!\!\! } 
\right) }.
\label{eq:partialhalflife_theory}
\eea
Here, $K = (\hbar c)^6 2\pi^3 \hbar \ln(2) (\me c^2)^{-5}$ is a simple combination of physical constants, and, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:mathdescription_intro}, $C_V$ ($C_A$) is the universal complex coupling parameter associated with vector (axial) currents, while $M_F$ ($M_{GT}$) is the transition matrix element associated with vector (axial) coupling for a specific decay.
%are as described in \emph{e.g.} Section~\ref{sec:mathdescription_intro}.  
$G_F$ is the weak interaction coupling constant, which is measured experimentally through muon decay.  $V_{ud}$ is the up-down mixing element within the \ac{CKM} matrix; its precise determination is an active area of research, motivated in part by the attempt to search for or constrain the possible presence of a fourth generation of quarks.  

It is worthwhile, at this stage, to briefly discuss the corrections to the Fermi and Gamow-Teller matrix elements, $M_F$ and $M_{GT}$, that have already been implicitly applied.  Although the uncorrected matrix elements $M_F^0$ and $M_{GT}^0$ are in some sense the more fundamental quantities, the corrected matrix elements are what is measured by an experiment.  $M_F^0$ and $M_{GT}^0$ are related to their corrected counterparts according to:
\bea
|M_F|^2    &=& (1+\delta_R^\prime) (1 + \delta_{NS}^V - \delta_C^V) (1+\Delta_R^V) \, |M_F^0|^2
\label{eq:MF_expand}
\\
|M_{GT}|^2 &=& (1+\delta_R^\prime) (1 + \delta_{NS}^A - \delta_C^A) (1+\Delta_R^A) \, |M_{GT}^0|^2 , 
\label{eq:MGT_expand}
\eea 
where $\delta_C^{V}$ ($\delta_C^{A}$) is the isospin symmetry breaking correction for the vector (axial-vector) current.  Here, $\delta^\prime_R$ is the portion of the outer radiative correction (\emph{i.e.}, it is dependent on the specific transition in question) that depends \emph{only trivially} on the nucleus; it is identically the same for vector and axial couplings.  The $\delta_{NS}^V$ ($\delta_{NS}^A$) term is the portion of the outer radiative correction for the vector (axial-vector) current with a \emph{non-trivial} dependence on nuclear structure.  These require a detailed shell model calculation to evaluate, as described in \emph{e.g.}  Refs.~\cite{TownerHardy2008,JausRasche1990,barker1992,Towner1992,Towner1994}.  Finally, the quantities $\Delta_R^V$ and $\Delta_R^A$ arise from inner radiative corrections (\emph{i.e.}, independent of the specific transition being considered) to the vector and axial-vector currents, and may be calculated as in Refs.~\cite{MarcianoSirlin_1986,MarcianoSirlin_2006,CzarneckiMarcianoSirlin_2019,Hayen2021}.  Although they do not depend on the specifics of any transition, the $\Delta_R^V$ and $\Delta_R^A$ terms are included here within the expressions for (transition-specific) $M_F$ and $M_{GT}$ for our later convenience.  This convention is sometimes, but not always, followed within the published literature~\cite{SeverijnsTandecki2008,HardyTownerSuperallowed2020}.

We will now consider the special case of superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ decay (of which $^{37}$K is \emph{not} an example).  As a general rule, these are strong, clean transitions which proceed only through vector coupling with no axial components.  Quantitatively, this amounts to setting $|M_{GT}^0|^2=0$ and $|M_F^0|^2=2$ within Eq.~(\ref{eq:partialhalflife_theory}).  As always, $C_V=1$ by construction.  With all axial couplings eliminated completely, the superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ decays are
%As such, they are 
%%very well suited to extract (using other experimentally measured parameters) a measure of the fundamental vector coupling strength.  
ideal candidates for measurements of the fundamental vector coupling strength.
If the \ac{CVC} hypothesis holds (and there is some reason to believe that it does~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006,HardyTownerSuperallowed2020}), then this coupling strength is common to \emph{all} transitions.  We will soon see how knowledge of this absolute vector coupling strength taken from measurements of $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ decay allows us to make predictions about the decay of $^{37}$K as well.  
\note[done,nolist]{My apologies for speculating more needs to be said about $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ -- that's not her main concern-- but it might help to add a further qualitative sentence after

with something like
\\
`We will need this absolute strength for the vector part of 37K decay when we get the ratio of vector and axial vector matrix elements from our fT value and predict our observables.'
}

In practice, the $ft$ values measured in superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ transitions need some small corrections in order to arrive at a universally applicable measure of the vector coupling strength.  We define a corrected $ft$ value for these transitions, $\mathcal{F}t^{0^+\!\rightarrow0^+}$ (sometimes simply $\mathcal{F}t$), as:
\bea
\mathcal{F}t^{0^+\!\rightarrow0^+} &:=& 
\left( f_V t \right) 
\!
\Bigg\rvert_{0^+\!\rightarrow0^+_{\phantom .}}
\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\! 
(1 + \delta^\prime_R)(1 + \delta_{NS}^V - \delta_C^{V} ) 
\label{eq:Ft_with_fVt}\\
&=& 
\frac{K \phantom{x^{x^x}_x} }{2 \, G_F^2 \, V_{ud}^2 (1+\Delta_R^V) } , 
\label{eq:Ft_with_Vud}
\eea
where we have made use of Eq.~(\ref{eq:partialhalflife_theory}).  
\aside[note]{I think we've probably assumed something like 
\\
$C_V |M_F^0|_{0^+\!\rightarrow0^+} = 2$ ? } 
Within Eqs.~(\ref{eq:Ft_with_fVt})-(\ref{eq:Ft_with_Vud}) above, only the parameters $t$ and $G_F$ are measured directly, while the other parameters must be calculated.  If all measurements and calculations have been performed perfectly, then Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ft_with_fVt}) is expected to yield the same $\mathcal{F}t$-value for \emph{any} superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ transition, as the contributions from nuclear structure have all been removed.  The above relationship is commonly used to extract an experimental value for $V_{ud}$, which cannot be calculated directly.

While Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ft_with_Vud}) describes physical parameters that are universal, it is important to remember that we have only arrived at this result by specializing our description to the superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ transitions; Eqs.~(\ref{eq:Ft_with_fVt})-(\ref{eq:Ft_with_Vud}) are not applicable as-is to other types of transitions.  %, so the nuclear structure parameters of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:Ft_with_fVt})-(\ref{eq:Ft_with_Vud}) must only be evaluated for this same class of decays.  
It is, however, also possible to write down an analogous expression to describe the universal vector coupling strength using parameters related to other types of decays.  As the axial current is not conserved, we will still only be interested in the vector components of such transitions, and it will take a bit more work to separate these out within a transition where both couplings contribute.  We will consider the mixed (Fermi/Gamow-Teller) mirror decays (of which $^{37}$K \emph{is} an example).  Again, $C_V=1$ (it is a universal parameter), however for the case of mirror transitions, $M_F^0 = 1$ and $M_{GT}\neq0$.

It is useful, at this stage, to recall the definition of $\rho$, the axial-vector/vector mixing ratio for a specific transition from Eq.~(\ref{eq:definerho_intro}).  In the notation of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:MF_expand})-(\ref{eq:MGT_expand}), we have:
\bea
\rho &:=& \frac{C_A \, M_{GT} }{C_V \, M_F} 
\nonumber
\\
&=& \frac{C_A \, M_{GT}^0 }{C_V \, M_F^0}  \left[ \frac{(1 + \delta_{NS}^A - \delta_C^A) }{(1 + \delta_{NS}^V - \delta_C^V)} \frac{(1+\Delta_R^A)}{(1+\Delta_R^V)} \right]^{1/2}
\label{eq:rho_with_corrections}
\\
&\approx& \frac{C_A \, M_{GT}^0 }{C_V \, M_F^0}.
\eea


As before, we use Eq.~(\ref{eq:partialhalflife_theory}) to write down $f_V t$, this time for the mixed mirror \mbox{transitions}:
\bea
( f_V t ) \Bigg\rvert_{\mathrm{mirror}_{\phantom .}}
\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\! 
&=& 
\frac{K}{G_F^2 V_{ud}^2 C_V^2 |M_F|^2 \left(1 + \frac{f_A}{f_V}\rho^2 \right)} \label{eq:156}
\\
&=& 
\frac{K}{G_F^2 V_{ud}^2 (1 + \delta^\prime_R) (1 + \delta_{NS}^V - \delta_C^V)(1+\Delta_R^V) \left(1 + \frac{f_A}{f_V}\rho^2 \right)},  \label{eq:157}
\;\;\;\; 
%\frac{K}{G_F^2 V_{ud}^2 C_V^2 |M_F|^2 \left(1 + \frac{f_A}{f_V}\frac{C_A^2}{C_V^2} \frac{|M_{GT}|^2}{|M_F|^2} \right)}.  
\eea
where Eq.~(\ref{eq:MF_expand}) is used to relate Eq.~(\ref{eq:156}) to Eq.~(\ref{eq:157}).  
We now define a corrected $\mathcal{F}t$ value, $\mathcal{F}t^{\mathrm{mirror}}$, for mirror transitions by 
applying the same nuclear structure corrections that were used in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ft_with_fVt}).  Then:
\bea
\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!
\mathcal{F}t^{\mathrm{mirror}} &:=& 
( f_V t ) \Bigg\rvert_{\mathrm{mirror}_{\phantom .}}
\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\! 
(1 + \delta^\prime_R)(1 + \delta_{NS}^V - \delta_C^{V} ) 
\nonumber \\
&=& 
\frac{K}{G_F^2 V_{ud}^2 (1+\Delta_R^V)
\left(1 + \frac{f_A}{f_V}\rho^2 \right) } 
\label{eq:Ftmirror_withVud}

\eea

Using a measured value of $\rho$, it is possible to extract a measurement of $V_{ud}$ from Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ftmirror_withVud}) above.  However, as a separate measurement of $\rho$ is not always available, it is perhaps more common to approach the above result as a way to \emph{find} $\rho$.  Comparing with Eqs.~(\ref{eq:Ft_with_Vud}) and (\ref{eq:Ftmirror_withVud}):  
\bea
\mathcal{F}t^{0^+\!\rightarrow0^+}
&=& 
\frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \frac{f_A}{f_V}\rho^2 \right) \mathcal{F}t^{\mathrm{mirror}}.
\label{eq:Ft_and_Ftmirror}
\eea
We see, perhaps counterintuitively, that Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ft_and_Ftmirror}) makes it possible to extract the value of $\rho$ for one transition by using (in part) information measured in an entirely separate class of transitions.  

Of course, this method for evaluating $\rho$ relies on the accuracy and precision of the theoretical calculations involved to reach this point.  It is worth noting that the lepton phase space integrals $f_V$ and $f_A$ for vector and axial couplings, which directly affect the extracted value of $\rho$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ft_and_Ftmirror}) above, are identically the same under the allowed approximation.  However, when higher-order corrections are taken into account, they are found to differ by $\sim 0.9\%$ for the primary $^{37}$K decay branch~\cite{HayenSeverijns2019}.

So e.g. t\_1/2 is wildly different for the 0+ to 0+ decays (t1/2 for $^{14}$O is a minute, not a second like 38mK) but once you correct for the wildly different phase space (the Coulomb energies and therefore the decay Q-value smoothly grow, and phase space goes like $Q^5$) the Ft rates are close (closer once percent corrections from isospin mixing and nucleus-dependent radiative corrections are applied).

\section{Thesis Goals}
\label{sec:thesisgoals}
This thesis describes, in detail, a precision measurement to search for exotic physics --- scalar and tensor components of the nuclear weak force in particular.  While Ch.~\ref{intro_chapter} and Ch.~\ref{atomicphysics_chapter} focus on selected background material of a general nature, much of this is needed to understand the experimental setup and analysis described in subsequent chapters.

The details relating to the experimental apparatus and setup are presented in Ch.~\ref{experimental_chapter}, and Chs.~\ref{calibrations_chapter},~\ref{simulations_chapter}, and~\ref{systematics_chapter} each focus on a different aspect of the analysis process.  Ch.~\ref{calibrations_chapter} discusses the initial data cleaning, including detector calibrations and selection of cuts.  Ch.~\ref{simulations_chapter} describes the simulation and modelling efforts undertaken to thoroughly describe the experimental data.  These simulations are critical for evaluating systematic uncertainties.  

The reader is then in a position to understand Ch.~\ref{systematics_chapter}, which details how each systematic effect is evaluated and incorporated into the resultant measurement.  Finally, Ch.~\ref{results_chapter} presents the results from this project, attempting to place them in a broader context.
