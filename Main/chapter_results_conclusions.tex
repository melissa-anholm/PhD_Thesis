After corrections have been applied and uncertainties evaluated, statistical confidence intervals for the 2D $\Abeta$ vs $\bFierz$ parameter space are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2dchi2_alldata} for all datasets combined.  The final estimates of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$ with uncertainties at the $1\sigma$ level are given by:
\bea
\bFierz =& \,0.033  &\!\!\! \pm\, 0.084(\textrm{stat})\;\, \pm\, 0.039(\textrm{sys})  \\
\Abeta  =& -0.5738 &\!\!\! \pm\, 0.0082(\textrm{stat})    \pm\, 0.0041(\textrm{sys}),

\section{Comparison to TRINAT's Prior $\Abeta$ Measurement}
\label{sec:compare_Abeta}
\note{Here, I have to move over some of the other section's stuff.
Also, talk about how this measurement compares with the collaboration's previous.}
The uncertainty associated with this measurement of $\Abeta$ is significantly larger than the collaboration's previous measurement of $\Abeta$ using the same data, in which the final result was $\mbox{$\Abeta = -0.5707 \pm 0.0013(\textrm{stat}) \pm 0.0013(\textrm{sys}) \pm 0.0005(\textrm{pol})$}$~\cite{ben_Abeta} before correcting for a data selection issue that only became apparent after publication.  However, it must be noted that the present measurement is a two-parameter measurement rather than a one-parameter measurement, so it is expected that the uncertainty associated with a single parameter should be larger.

To evaluate whether the two measurements are consistent, a thin vertical slice of Fig.~\ref{fig:2dchi2_alldata} can be extracted at $\bFierz=0$, and its projection will provide the centroid (including systematic offsets) and statistical error associated with a one-parameter analysis for $\Abeta$ --- though this method cannot produce an estimate of the extent to which systematic uncertainties might be different.  This simple check gives a one-parameter measurement of $\Abeta = -0.5714 \pm 0.0020(\textrm{stat})$.

The above one-parameter result for $\Abeta$ is consistent with the collaboration's prior uncorrected \emph{and} corrected results, even after one accounts for the fact that the previous result suffered from an oversight in which some partially polarized data was not removed from the final analysis for $\Abeta$, despite the fact that this cut \emph{was} implemented in the associated polarization measurement.  This accounts for $5\%$ of the data used in that analysis, and is estimated to decrease the average polarization by approximately $0.3\%$.  
\note[tag]{Somewhere I have to say what the polarization actually was.}
An estimate of the size of the effect on the previous measurement of $\Abeta$ suggests that the true value of $\Abeta$ is likely to be $\sim 0.0016$ more negative than reported.  
%Furthermore, there is no uncertainty associated with polarization described within the present analysis, simply because to leading order there is no effect on $\bFierz$, although it strongly affects a measurement of $\Abeta$.  
Accounting for this, a more accurate one-parameter measurement might produce the result, $\mbox{$\Abeta \approx -0.5723 \pm 0.0014(\textrm{stat}) \pm 0.0013(\textrm{sys}) \pm 0.0005(\textrm{pol})$}$.



\section{Relation to Present Limits on Scalar and Tensor Interactions}
\label{sec:scalartensorlimits}
\label{sec:relation_to_other_measurements}
\note{begin literal quote from John:}
The best existing measurement of the Fierz interference term is in the decay of the neutron, with
\mbox{$\bFierz = 0.017 \pm 0.021$} --- consistent with the Standard Model prediction of zero, and with previous results for the neutron's $\bFierz$~\cite{Saul2020}\cite{UCNAfierz2020}. Our measurement is strongly related, yet complementary.  
%
This result for $\bFierz$ cannot be directly compared to our result in $^{37}$K, because the neutron's sensitivity to scalar and tensor couplings is different than our own.  In particular, using $\lambda := \frac{g_A M_{GT}}{g_V M_F}$, a parameter unique to a given transition (see Eq.~(\ref{eq:definelambda}) and the related discussion), we find:
%
%In terms of non-Standard Model Lorentz current structures, to lowest order in the non-SM  currents the same equation applies:\aside{John's $\bFierz$ equation was off...}
\bea
\bFierz &=& \frac{\pm 2\gamma}{1 + \lambda^2} \left( \frac{g_S}{g_V} + \lambda^2 \frac{g_T}{g_A} \right)
%\bFierz = \pm \frac{(C_S +C_S') + (C_T - C_T') \lambda^2}{ 1 + \lambda^2}
\eea
where the top/bottom sign is for $\beta^-$/$\beta^+$ decay, and $g_X$ ($X = \{ V,A,S,T\} $) is a purely left-handed coupling for vectors, axial-vectors, scalars, and tensors~\cite{jtw}\cite{jtw_coulomb}.
%~\aside{I think we're missing a $\gamma$.}
%(the plus is for $\beta^-$ decay and the - for $\beta^+$ decay)
In the case of $^{37}$K, a previous measurement puts $ | \lambda | \approx 0.576 $, while, in the case of the neutron, $ | \lambda | \approx 1.277 $~\cite{ben_Abeta}\cite{NeutronAbeta2018}.
%%$\lambda$ is close to $\sqrt{3/5}$ (the expected value of \mbox{$J/(J+1)$} for a single $J=3/2$, $d 3/2$ nucleon)~\cite{deShalit1963}
%%In our $^{37}$K case, $\lambda^2$ = $|M_{\rm GT}|^2$/$|M_{\rm F}|^2$ is close to 3/5 (the expected value of \mbox{$J/(J+1)$} for a single $J=3/2$, $d 3/2$ nucleon)~\cite{deShalit1963},
%%while for the neutron $\lambda^2$ is close to 3 (the expected value for a $(J+1)/J$, $J=1/2$, $s1/2$ nucleon).
The Fermi matrix element, $|M_F|$, is nearly the same for both of these isospin = 1/2 decays (the largest correction is the larger isospin mixing of $\sim$0.01 in $^{37}$K).
This means that our observable is comparatively less sensitive to Lorentz tensor currents, and will predominantly constrain or discover Lorentz scalar currents.  See Fig.~(\ref{fig:exclusionplotfromjohn}).

However, measurements of the superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ beta decays are able to produce constraints on scalar couplings which are unrivaled by any other type of measurement, and improving with every experimental generation.  Though these transitions offer no sensitivity at all to tensor couplings, it would be incredibly difficult for a mixed transition measurement such as ours to compete on scalar coupling limits with the superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ transitions.  At the time of writing, the superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ transition measurements have together produced a constraint of \mbox{$\left| C_S / C_V \right| \leq 0.0010$} at the $1\sigma$ confidence level~\cite{HardyTownerSuperallowed2020}.

\section{Possible Future Work:  $R_{\textrm{slow}}$}
\label{section_rslow}
%\subsection{Background}
As discussed in Ch.~\ref{intro_chapter}, the nuclear weak force is known to be a predominantly left-handed vector and axial-vector $(V-A)$ interaction -- meaning that immediately following an interaction (e.g. beta decay) with a weak force carrying boson ($W^+,\: W^-,\: Z$), 
normal-matter leptons (such as the electron and electron neutrino) emerge with left-handed chirality,
while the anti-leptons (e.g. the positron and electron anti-neutrino) emerge with right-handed chirality.  

In the limit of massless particles, the particle's chirality is the same as its helicity. Thus, in a left-handed model, the direction of an (ultrarelativistic) normal lepton's spin is antiparallel direction of its motion, and the direction of spin for an anti-lepton is parallel to its direction of motion.  For a non-relativistic particle the property of chirality is fairly abstract, and describes the appropriate group representation and projection operators to be used in calculations.  It should be noted that a fully chiral model is also one which is maximally parity violating.

This odd quirk of the nuclear weak force is not only \emph{predominantly} true, but it is, to the best of our current scientific knowledge, \emph{always} true -- that is, attempts to measure any right-handed chiral components of the weak force have produced results consistent with zero~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006}\cite{severijns_cuncic_2011}.  This project proposes a further measurement to constrain the strength of the right-handed component of the weak interaction.  

Although the primary focus of this thesis is a search for exotic scalar and tensor couplings within the weak force, it is clear that a precision search for right-handed vector and axial-vector $(V+A)$ interactions would be motivated by very similar rationale.

In the proposed experiment, we focus once again on the spin-polarized decay, \mbox{$^{37}\textrm{K} \rightarrow \,^{37}\textrm{\!Ar} + \beta^{+} + \nu_e$}, exploiting the principle of conservation of angular momentum as it applies to this transition.  The proposed analysis could be performed on the data that has already been collected, although as we will see, there are some inherent difficulties to this approach which might be eliminated with a fresh set of decay data.

%It would be possible to perform such an analysis

%An experiment is proposed to further test that observation, constraining the strength of right-handed (V+A) currents by exploiting the principle of conservation of angular momentum within a spin-polarized beta decay process.  %\comment{
%Here, we focus on the decay \mbox{$^{37}\textrm{K} \rightarrow \,^{37}\textrm{\!Ar} + \beta^{+} + \nu_e$}.

However, we are able to describe the probability distribution for the kinematics of the daughter particles in a beta decay reaction in terms of both right- and left-handed interactions, and scalar, tensor, vector, and axial couplings.  
%It is therefore possible to perform tests of the Standard Model by precisely measuring the kinematics within a beta decay process.  
%This document will focus predominantly on a search for right-handed interactions within the decay process, $^{37}\textrm{K} \rightarrow \,^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}^{+n} + \beta^{+} + \nu_e + (n+1)e^-$.

%\comment{ We obtain a sample of neutral, cold, nuclear spin-polarized $^{37}\textrm{K}$ atoms with a known spatial position, via the TRIUMF accelerator facility, by intermittently running a magneto-optical trap (MOT) to confine and cool the atoms, then cycling the trap off to polarize the atoms.  With $\beta$ detectors placed opposite each other along the axis of polarization, we are able to directly observe the momenta of $\beta^+$ particles emitted into 1.4\% of the total solid angle nearest this axis.  We also are able to extract a great deal of information about the momentum of the recoiling $^{37\!}$Ar daughters by measuring their times of flight and hit positions on a microchannel plate detector with a delay line.  Because the nuclear polarization is known to within $<0.1\%$~\cite{ben_OP}, and we are able to account for many systematic effects by periodically reversing the polarization and by collecting unpolarized decay data while the atoms are trapped within the MOT, we expect to be well equipped to implement a test of `handedness' within the nuclear weak force. }

%\section{The Principle of the Measurement}
%\label{principle}
%\comment{ Of particular interest is the decay process: $^{37}\textrm{K} \rightarrow \,^{37}\textrm{\!Ar} + \beta^{+} + \nu_e$.  Among other useful properties, this is is a `mirror' decay, 
%meaning that the nuclear wavefunctions of the parent and daughter are identical up to their isospin quantum number.  
%the number of protons in the parent nucleus (19) is equal to the number of neutrons in the daughter, and the number of neutrons in the parent (18) is equal to the number of protons in the daughter.  
%This property allows us to place strong constraints on the size of the theoretical uncertainties for this decay process within the Standard Model.   We further exploit this property by noting that both the $^{37}\textrm{K}$ parent and the $^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}$ daughter have nuclear spin $I=3/2$, a fact which is key to this experiment. }

%We propose to exploit the principle of conservation of angular momentum to search for right-handed currents.  Given a sample of cold, spatially confined, spin-polarized atoms which decay according to a known scheme, we propose to observe the kinematics of the daughter particles and thereby reconstruct beta decay event information.  
%
%In particular, given a fully spin-polarized ($m_I=\pm I$) 
%$\asdf37K$
%$^{37}\textrm{K}$ nucleus, the $^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}$ daughter may not take on a higher spin quantum number.  This puts a limit on the kinematics of the decay process.  If we assume, as per the Standard Model, that the spin-$1/2$ $\beta^+$ must emerge in a spin eigenstate parallel to its direction of motion (up to relativistic corrections), and that furthermore, the normal-matter $\nu_e$ must emerge with spin anti-parallel to its direction of motion.  Then, in the limiting case where the $\beta^+$ and the $\nu_e$ emerge exactly back-to-back, the Standard Model predicts that we will have changed the nuclear spin quantum number $m_I$ (as quantized along the `back-to-back' axis) by one unit.  However if, as per our assumption, the parent nucleus was already fully `spun up' in state $m_I = +3/2$, then $m_I$ may only decrease.
%
%In terms of beta decay kinematics, this means that given a $^{37}\textrm{K}$ nucleus which is spin-polarized to point upwards, if we observe a `back-to-back' decay along the axis of polarization, the Standard Model tells us that we can expect that the $\beta^+$ has gone upwards and the $\nu_e$ has gone downwards.  If we observe an event where the opposite is true, then we will have observed `new' physics beyond the predictions of the Standard Model (See Figure~\ref{fig:rhc}).

The decays are labelled according to the type(s) of interaction that could produce them (vector, axial vector, scalar, and tensor).  By fully spin-polarizing the parent nucleus in a mirror decay, we are able to exclude diagrams (a) and (b).  Diagram (c), which represents the `left-handed' linear combination of vector and axial vector interactions, is the only one of these processes allowed within the Standard Model. Subfigure (d) represents the `right-handed' combination of vector and axial vector interactions.  Subfigures (e), (f), (g), and (h) could be produced by linear combinations of scalar and tensor interactions, neither of which have been observed within the Standard Model.  
%Within our experimental set-up we do not measure the spin of daughter particles directly, and therefore the decays in the top row (a, c, e, g) would be indistinguishable from one another, and decays in the bottom row (b, d, f, h) would also be indistinguishable from one another.  However since none of the latter event types would be possible under the Standard Model, an observation of this event type would be indicative of the presence of scalar, tensor, or right-handed interactions within the nuclear weak force.

%The problem, then, becomes one of designing an experiment which will allow us to isolate beta decay events with the desired signature from the more mundane beta decay events predicted by the Standard Model.  

%
%\section{The Experimental Setup}

%The TRIUMF Neutral Atom Trap (TRINAT) offers an experimental set-up which is uniquely suited to precision tests of Standard Model beta decay physics.  Radioactive ions are delivered from the ISAC beamline and neutralized before being trapped in the first of two magneto-optical traps (MOTs).  Approximately once per second, atoms from the first MOT are transferred to the second, where their decay products can be observed with significantly less background than would have been possible in the first trap (see Figure~\ref{fig:doublemot}).  The transfer methodology is discussed in some detail in a paper by Swanson et al~\cite{swanson}.
%
%Once the newly transferred atoms -- in this case, neutral $^{37}\textrm{K}$ -- have arrived at the second trap, the MOT cycles 500 times between a state where it is `on' and actively confining atoms to a region of approximately 2\,mm$^3$, to a state where it is `off' and instead the atoms are spin-polarized by optical pumping while the atom cloud expands ballistically before being re-trapped.  In order to eliminate systematic effects, the polarization direction is flipped every 16 seconds.  This optical pumping technique and its results are the subject of a recent publication~\cite{ben_OP}.

%	\label{fig:themot}
%\end{figure}
%
%The need to use an AC-MOT rather than a typical MOT has arisen as a direct result of our desire to optimally polarize our sample of atoms.  Polarization is incompatible with the non-uniform magnetic field used by a MOT, and rapidly shutting off the current used to produce the MOT's magnetic field produces eddy currents in the surrounding materials, which in turn produce their own non-uniform magnetic field in the region of interest.  The AC-MOT is developed as a way to ensure that the unavoidable eddy currents are behaving as we expect.  With an appropriate choice of shut-off phase, the current in the coils can be shut off when the overall magnetic field is already zero, so that no further eddy currents are induced.   
%

%
%In order to optimally polarize a sample of atoms by this method, it is necessary to have precise control over the magnetic field.  This is because absent other forces, a spin will undergo Larmor precession about the magnetic field lines.  In particular, the magnetic field must be aligned along the polarization axis (otherwise the tendency will be to actually depolarize the atoms), and it must be uniform in magnitude over the region of interest (otherwise its divergencelessness will result in the field also having a non-uniform direction, which results in a spatially-dependent depolarization mechanism).  Note that this type of magnetic field is not compatible with the MOT, which requires a quadrupolar magnetic field \emph{gradient}, and has necessitated our use of the AC-MOT as described in Subsection~\ref{trap}.

%
%In order to make best use of these MCPs, we create an electric field in order to draw positively charged particles into one MCP, while drawing negatively charged electrons into the other MCP.  Seven electrostatic hoops have been placed within the chamber (see Figure~\ref{fig:thechamber}), and are connected to a series of high voltage power supplies.  See Sections~\ref{photoions} and~\ref{pos_recoils} for a discussion of what sort of charged particles we expect to observe in these detectors and how they are created.  
%  

%Scientific data has been collected at field strengths of 395 V/cm, 415 V/cm, and 535 V/cm.  It should be noted that these field strengths are too low to significantly perturb any but the least energetic of the (positively charged) betas from the decay process, and these low energy betas would already have been unable to reach the upper and lower beta detectors due to interactions with materials in the SiC mirror and Be foil vacuum seal.

%\subsection{The Decay Process}
%\label{rslow_decayprocess}
%\label{pos_recoils}
The decay process is as described in Appendix~\ref{appendix_forthepeople}.  Within the \ac{JTW} formalism, information about the handedness of any couplings is buried within the relative signs of the primed and un-primed coupling constants ($C_X$ and $C_X^\prime$, for $X = \{ V,A,S,T\}$).  Since this section describes a search for a different type of exotic physics, it is clear that the simplifications to be made within the \ac{JTW} formalism will be different.  
% with the exception being the simplifications that can be made to the \ac{JTW} formalism.  
Recall that for the expected pure left-handed interactions, the coupling constants obey the rule, $C_X = C_X^\prime$ ($X = \{ V,A,S,T,P\}$).  For a purely right-handed interaction, the equivalent relationship is $C_X = - C_X^\prime$.  Since we know, at least for vectors and axial vectors, that the interaction must still be predominantly left-handed, one way to approach the problem is to define a new basis for the couplings to explicitly split the left-handed and right-handed couplings, as in:
\bea
C_X^{L} &:=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(C_X + C_X^\prime)
\\
C_X^{R} &:=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(C_X - C_X^\prime).
\eea

The decay may be treated as a three-body problem in which the available kinetic energy is divided up between the beta, the neutrino, and the recoiling $^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}$ nucleus, and (of course) the total linear and angular momentum are conserved.  While the neutrino cannot be detected directly, its kinematics may be reconstructed from observations of the beta and the recoiling daughter nucleus.  By placing detectors above and below the decaying atom along the axis of its polarization, we are able to obtain information about the outgoing beta's energy and momentum, in the cases of interest to us, where it is emitted along (or close to) the axis of polarization.  

It should be noted that for the class of decays of greatest interest, where the beta and the neutrino emerge back-to-back along the polarization axis, the recoiling daughter nucleus will have zero momentum along the directions perpendicular to this axis, and on average less total energy than if the beta and neutrino were emitted in a parallel direction.  Henceforth, daughter nuclei from a back-to-back decay as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rhc} will be described as `slow' recoils.  In terms of observables, 
%these slow recoils, upon being swept into a detector by an ambient electric field, 
this means that if the electric field is configured to point along one of the axes perpendicular to the polarization direction, then when the recoiling ion is swept away into a detector, the slow recoil's hit position should be exactly along the projection of the polarization axis.  Furthermore, the slow recoil's time of flight should be in the middle of the time of flight spectrum, since other recoils will be emitted with momentum towards or away from the detector.  Of course, this is a simplistic description; in nature, no matter how strong the right-handed couplings, emitted particles will have a continuous angular spectrum -- the above is only meant to describe the angular set up which would give us maximal sensitivity to observables relating to right-handed currents.

	\caption[A Comparison of Left-Handed and Right-Handed Couplings]{A comparison of left-handed and right-handed vector and axial couplings in polarized beta decay.  The above are extremal examples;  in nature there is no requirement for the leptons to be emitted back-to-back, or for either to be emitted along the axis of polarization.  However the class of events with minimal momentum allocated to the recoiling daughter nucleus (i.e., the result of back-to-back lepton emission) is what provides the most sensitivity to the $\Rslow$ observable, and a $\beta$ coincidence (our detectors are located along the axis of polarization) is required.
	The precise scenario on the right is the only one that is \emph{completely} disallowed in the absence of right-handed couplings, and only if the neutrinos are taken to be massless.  For intermediate decay scenarios, the probability is simply suppressed based on the extent to which the usual left-handed coupling can access the phase space.

\end{figure}

The recoiling $^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}$ nucleus is a bit trickier to work with in some ways than an outgoing beta particle, but it is possible to do, and a necessary component of this measurement.  One useful feature of the $^{37}\textrm{K} \rightarrow \,^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}$ transition is that, in addition to the $\beta^+$ emitted in the decay itself, one or more \emph{orbital} electrons from the parent atom are typically lost.  In the majority of decay events only one orbital electron is shaken off, which results in the daughter $^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}$ atom being electrically neutral~\cite{gorelov2000}\cite{dan_thesis}.  In the remaining cases, two or more orbital electrons are lost this way, and the daughter atom is positively charged.  If we apply an electric field perpendicular to the direction of polarization, these positively charged $^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}^{(+n)}$ ions may be collected into a detector, from which hit position and time of flight information may be extracted.  The shake-off electrons are emitted with an average energy of only $\sim$ 2\,eV so to a very good approximation the other decay products are not perturbed by the presence of shake-off electrons\cite{Levinger}.  

The potential exists to use these shake-off electrons as a tag for good events, in a way similar to what has been done in the present measurements of $\bFierz$ and $\Abeta$.  This could greatly improve the cleanliness of the spectra.  Unfortunately, within the 2014 data that has already been collected, the recoil detector and electron detector could not be made to work simultaneously.  Some of the resulting spectra are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RslowSpectra}.  While an analysis to search for right-handed interactions could be performed on existing data, it would likely \emph{significantly} improve the results if a new dataset were collected with both \ac{MCP} detectors working at the same time.

In June 2014, approximately 7 days of beam time at TRIUMF was dedicated to the TRINAT $^{37}\textrm{K}$ beta decay experiment.  During this period, approximately 10,000 atoms were held within the trap at any given time.  The cleaned spectra show around 50,000 polarized beta-recoil coincidence events in total, divided among measurements at three different electric field strengths (535 V/cm, 415 V/cm, 395 V/cm).

Approximately half of this data was collected with the recoil MCP in use and is therefore suitable for use in this project to search for right-handed currents;  the other half is used as described within the rest of this document to search for scalar and tensor couplings.   

A fit to simulation has shown that the data that has already been collected has sufficient statistical power to measure the \emph{fractional} contribution of any polarized `new physics' beta decay parameter (ie right-handed, scalar, and tensor currents within the weak interaction) to a sensitivity of $\sim 2\%$ of its true value.  Systematic limitations are still being assessed.

\\...\\
hi Melissa,
\\...\\
I think you should keep Section 6.2, but I think it would be clearer to point out the observable manifests as a dip in the raw TOF spectrum, not going all the way to zero as in the ideal on-axis situation you describe for simplicity.
I.e., I would say you need to qualify this "exactly" word (emphasis mine below), and since
it ends up as a cos(theta) distribution like in my attached slide on the subject, your figure of the TOF spectrum would be a good way to do that.
\\...\\
"Henceforth, daughter nuclei from a back-to-back decay as shown in
Figure ?? will be described as ‘slow’ recoils. In terms of observables, this means that
if the electric field is configured to point along one of the axes perpendicular to the
polarization direction, then when the recoiling ion is swept away into a detector, the
slow recoil’s hit position should be \textbf{exactly}​​ along the projection of the polarization
axis. Furthermore, the slow recoil’s time of flight should be in the middle of the time
of flight spectrum, since other recoils will be emitted with momentum towards or
away from the detector"

%Using $^{37}\textrm{K}$ beta decay data collected in June 2014, I intend to reconstruct the recoil momenta both along the polarization axis and perpendicular to it, such that when combined with energy and hit position from the beta detectors, each event's full kinematics may be reconstructed.  The spectra created by these events will be compared against a series of Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations.  
%
%Matched template fitting will be used to compare the experimental data to the simulation, meaning that the implicit vector, axial, scalar, and tensor couplings within Eq.~\ref{jtw_pdf} will be allowed to float separately within the simulation, and a series of simulation ``templates'' will be produced, and each separately fit to the data.  The quality of each fit will be used to determine a ``best'' experimental value for both parameters, as well as the error inherent in the measurement.

%%%\subsection{Status of the $R_{\textrm{slow}}$ Measurement}
%%%\label{rslow_status}
%%%In June 2014, after several years of preparatory work beforehand (the author has been continuously involved with this project since 2010), approximately 7 days of beam time at TRIUMF was dedicated to the TRINAT $^{37}\textrm{K}$ beta decay experiment.  Approximately half of this data is suitable for use in this project.  During this period, approximately 10,000 atoms were held within the trap at any given time.  The cleaned spectra show around 50,000 polarized beta-recoil coincidence events in total, divided among measurements at three different electric field strengths (535 V/cm, 415 V/cm, 395 V/cm). 
%%%
%%%%At the present time, analysis is underway.  The recoil MCP hit position data has been calibrated, and systematic effects in the trap position and size measurements are being considered.  The largest two remaining hurdles for the analysis both lie in improvements to the Monte Carlo.  
%%%
%%%%The first challenge is to implement particle tracking within a \emph{non-uniform} electric field.  Using the true non-uniform electric field will shift the time-of-flight spectra overall by around 1\%, and is expected to change the \emph{shape} of spectra as well, since the deviation from uniformity changes significantly as a function of flight tragectory, and is greater the farther a particle ventures from the central axis.  This would affect the measured hit positions as well.  Taken together, the shape of the time-of-flight spectra (as in Figure~\ref{fig:Rslow_tof}) and the recoil hit position are critical to our reconstruction of the decay process, it is critical that we model them correctly.  
%%%
%%%%The second challenge will be to allow our simulation to vary vector, axial, scalar, and tensor coupling constants separately while holding other physical parameters (such as the half-life and Fermi/Gamow-Teller ratio) constant.  This, too, will be absolutely critical to the analysis, and its implementation is likely to be non-trivial.
%%%
%%%A fit to simulation has shown that the data that has already been collected has sufficient statistical power to measure the \emph{fractional} contribution of any polarized `new physics' beta decay parameter (ie right-handed, scalar, and tensor currents within the weak interaction) to a sensitivity of $\sim 2\%$ of its true value.  Systematic limitations are still being assessed.  
%%%%Because previous measurements have already shown that any $(V-A)$, $S$, and $T$ terms within the Standard Model must be quite small~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006}\cite{severijns_cuncic_2011}, the present measurement is not likely to be able to add any new constraints to our understanding of Standard Model physics, and must instead be understood as complementary to previous measurements.
%%%%Because previous measurements have

%%%
%%%%Approximately of beamtime and several years of preparatory work beforehand, and its analysis is currently underway.  The statistical strength of our data is sufficient for a \comment{5\%?  (John said 5\%, but I don't really know how he calculated that...)} measurement to constrain right-handed weak interactions, however the systematic effects within the data have not yet been fully evaluated.  This constraint is far too weak to allo w for the discovery of a right-handed component of the nuclear weak force, and is likely also too weak to place any new constraints on its strength.  It could, at best, lend statistical strength to the constraints on right-handed currents that have already been observed.
%%%%
%%%%Unfortunately, due to beam scheduling and target creation procedures at TRIUMF, and because several components of the TRINAT science chamber have subsequently been removed and disassembled to prepare for future upgrades to the apparatus, it would be extremely difficult to collect any further data in a timely fashion.

\section{Conclusions}
This two-parameter analysis to measure $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$ has produced the results:
\bea
\bFierz =& \,0.033  &\!\!\! \pm\, 0.084(\textrm{stat})\;\, \pm\, 0.039(\textrm{sys})  \\
\Abeta  =& -0.5738 &\!\!\! \pm\, 0.0082(\textrm{stat})    \pm\, 0.0041(\textrm{sys}),
\eea
where uncertainties are evaluated at 1$\sigma$.  This measurement of $\bFierz$ is consistent with the Standard Model value of $\bFierz=0$, and $\Abeta$ is consistent both with the collaboration's prior measurement of $\Abeta$, as well as with the value predicted by the standard model at $\Abeta=-0.5706\pm0.0007$.  \aside[tag]{somewhere, I have to define $\Abeta$ in terms of $\lambda$...}

The result for $\bFierz$ is dominated by statistical uncertainty, suggesting that the measurement could be improved simply by counting longer.  There is also room for improvement in the systematic uncertainty, which is dominated by scattering and the related measurements of material thicknesses.  

\note{begin direct quote from John:}
Largely because of this result,
the collaboration is working to reduce the largest systematics,
using lower-Z materials to reduce backscattering, and changing the silicon
$\delta$E to a multi-wire proportional chamber with very thin windows.
The collaboration has already implemented very thin pellicle mirrors.
The projected systematic uncertainty could approach 0.01 in a future
experment, which would then likely continue to be limited by statistics.

%\section{Stuff from John}
\note[jbn, nolist]{Another Round of Thoughts from John!
\\...\\
Fitting Ben's data (using for the bFierz function my convolution of 1/E with a Clifford tail) as I've shown before, compare what happens if I let Abeta float, or if I then fix Abeta arbitrarily to that floated value.
\\
That's not a well-motivated thing to do on its own, but it's not that much different than using Abeta[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] constrained by Ft[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] since that's only dependent on squares of small quantities.
\\...\\
So I would expect the ability to extract Cs and Ct from the 37K data to have more
sensitivity if Abeta[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] and Ft[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] and bFierz[Cs,Ct] are floated together in a 2d fit rather then floating Abeta and bFierz without any theoretical constraints and then considering getting linear combinations of Cs and Ct from the bFierz value.
\\...\\
Note that my simply fixing Abeta lowers bFierz uncertainty by a factor of 3. I expect similar improvement in sensitivity to Cs and Ct.
\\...\\
(Here I'm using Cs as a stand-in for (Cs+Cs')/2 for simplicity)

another basic big point. What would it mean if there were nonzero Cs, Ct? 
\\
In the context of the more elegant SM, a theory of quarks and leptons and mathematically consistent interactions, that would imply the existence of at least one extra unknown exchange boson. The mass would not be measured, just its coupling
strenghts to the particles participating in the beta decay.
\\...\\
Maybe background to understand that includes:
\\
If one were to write the SM weak interaction, $C_A$ and $C_V$ and $C_A$ and $C_V g_A$ would all be constants with abs value 1.
The (1+- gamma\_5)'s are projection operators-- in the SM, the W boson only couples to left-handed nu's and right-handed antinu's

('more will be said in the forward-looking Ch. 6.2 about tests of that part.)

So all the known information about Ca and Cv is accounted for.
