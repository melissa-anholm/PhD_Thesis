The collaboration has performed an independent analysis using (mostly) the same set of data to measure $\Abeta$, fixing $\bFierz$ to zero.
Differences with that analysis are interleaved in this section and summarized in Appendix~\ref{ch:differences_data}.
Critical physics improvements concern an eMCP-beta timing walk correction which enabled an improved cut against background, also incorporating a more complete modelling of decay backgrounds from untrapped atoms. Technical corrections include a correct treatment of the polarization cycle.
An arbitrary change in the DSSD

A simple estimate from the collaboration that builds intuition for this result:
Scatter in the SiC mirrors and DSSD actually produces an efficiency change at low
beta energy. Energy loss is not minimally ionizing in these structures, and instead
will have a long Landau tail that can take events below energy threshold in the scintillator.
The collaboration has modelled explicitly the false asymmetry as a function
of Kbeta between 600 and 1300 keV, producing roughly (K-0.6 MeV)/(0.7 MeV), i.e.
50\% at Kbeta=0.95 MeV. This efficiency degradation would be distributed roughly equally
between the SiC and DSSD.
If completely ignored, this would introduce by inspection a false bFierz of approximately
0.5.
Scattering effects will vary between linear and sqrt of thickness, so assuming
worst case of linear, the mechanical thickness uncertainty
of 5 micron/300 micron and 6 micron /275 micron, an average of 2\%, making
a random contribution of order 0.01 each.
The Be window has larger mechanical thickness uncertainty of 23micron/229 micron, but
energy loss and scattering in this material is 5x smaller, so the net effect would be similar.
\\ ... \\
To minimize this systematic for future experiments, the collaboration has
implemented pellicle mirrors of negligible thickness, 100 nm Au on 4 micron
kapton. The collaboration is also implementing Be-windowed wire chambers in
place of the DSSD.

\section{Comparing Simulations to Experimental Data:  The General Methodology}
\label{sec:comparing_data_sims}
The primary parameter measurement strategy in this project involved comparing the experimental data to a 2D parameter space of simulations, and this is true both for evaluation of the best parameter values, and also for evaluations of the uncertainties.  

As described in Section~\ref{signature_chapter}, and in more detail in Appendix~\ref{appendix:superratio}, the primary experimental observable is the superratio asymmetry, which is constructed from four experimental \emph{rates} of beta detection:
\bea
A_{\mathrm{super}}(\Ebeta) 
&=& 
\frac{ \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+} \phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) } }\; -\, \sqrt{ r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-}\phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} }{ \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T-}\, r_{\mathrm B+}\phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} \;+\, \sqrt{r_{\mathrm T+}\, r_{\mathrm B-} \phantom{ (\!\!\!\!\!) }} }.
\eea
This quantity is closely related to the two fundamental parameters we hope to extract, 
%$\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$, 
and in the absence of certain systematic effects, we can cleanly describe a relationship between the observable
%, $A_{\mathrm{super}}(\Ebeta)$, 
and the two physical parameters ($\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$) that we might use to describe the shape of an experimentally measured $A_{\mathrm{super}}(\Ebeta)$ curve:
\bea
A_{\mathrm{super}}(\Ebeta) 
&=&
%&\approx& 
\frac{\Abeta \, \frac{v}{c} \, |\vec{P}| \, \langle | \cos\theta | \rangle
}{
1 + \bFierz \frac{mc^2}{\Ebeta}
}.
\label{eq:AsuperAbetabFierz}
\eea

Of course, when all systematics are properly accounted for, Eq.~\ref{eq:AsuperAbetabFierz} is no longer an adequate description of the full relationship between the observable and physical parameters.  Therefore, to compare experimental and simulated data, a series of Geant4 simulations are performed, and the superratio asymmetries constructed, using identical cuts to those used with the experimental data.  The degree to which the simulations and experiment match is evaluated by using a $\chi^2$ comparison as the figure of merit.  This is repeated for a range of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$ values, and a $\chi^2$ mapping of the 2D parameter space is produced.  

A major caveat to the above description is that running a high statistics G4 simulation of our experiment is a computationally expensive process, so it was not possible to perform a separate simulation at every `pixel' within the parameter space.  Instead, to evaluate the central values of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$, only three simulations were performed for different values of $\bFierz$, all using the same nominal value for $\Abeta$.  The $A_{\mathrm{super}}(\Ebeta)$ spectra representing intermediate $\bFierz$ values were created from a linear combination of spectra generated at the two closest values of $\bFierz$.

To vary the effective $\Abeta$ value, the generated $A_{\mathrm{super}}(\Ebeta)$ spectrum was simply scaled.  From Eq.~\ref{eq:AsuperAbetabFierz} it is clear that this works well so long as $\bFierz$ is small and any systematics are evaluated separately.  

This method allows for an arbitrarily finely pixellated 2D $\chi^2$ map to be created.  It is done separately for each of the three experimental data sets so as to facilitate evaluation of systematic effects that changed between runsets.

That old list:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Run 3 sets of G4 simulations with a bunch of statistics (N events, for data with like N/10 events).  Each one has the same nominal value of $\Abeta$, but with 3 different values of the scalar coupling $C_S$:  zero, and +/-(whatever).  Keep $C_T=0$.  Because reasons, we're not really able to distinguish between $C_S$ and $C_T$ in this experiment anyway, so might as well keep the analysis simple.
	\item We used $C_S = C_S^\prime$ for this thing, and varied that.  In fact, $g_S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(C_S+C_S^\prime)$.
	\item Just run one set of 0.02*N events for the two percent branch.  We can't neglect it, but it isn't going to change much when we adjust BSM couplings.  Just use the old event generator from Holstein Eq.~(51).
	\item generate beta-SOE TOF spectra for simulated data.  
	\item generate background spectra and the TOF spectra to go with them.
%	\item make the same TOF cut on the simulated data and the experimental data.  
%	\item In fact, make all the same cuts on the experimental and simulated data.  DSSD cut, DSSD energy, one hit DSSD, one hit scint.  TOF cut, which requires a whole extra model of background in the TOF spectrum (see Section~\ref{sec:tof_bg}).
%%%	\begin{itemize}
%%%		\item Suppose background in the TOF spectrum is coming from decays of atoms that have gotten themselves stuck to surfaces within the chamber...
%%%		\item Run G4 to get a beta TOF spectrum (w.r.t. the decay)
%%%		\item Run COMSOL (credit to Alexandre) to track low-energy SOEs through the electric field from wherever they started, into the detectors.  Energy spectra from Levinger.
%%%		\item Combine G4 and COMSOL spectra, event-by-event, while requiring that both the beta detector and the eMCP are hit according to the set of random numbers generated by each monte carlo separately.  Then, the beta and SOE will each have a TOF from decay to detector, and subtracting one from the other gives a timing spectrum that can be observed experimentally.  See Fig.~\ref{fig:soetof}.
%%%		\item Upper limit for the fraction of events generated this way can be estimated by assuming that all losses from the trap not due to radioactive decay emerge isotropically from the trap and then stick to whatever chamber wall is in its path.  This upper limit is too big by a factor of 2.
%%%	\end{itemize}
	\item For each of those 3 simulations, sort the ``good'' data according to emission angle relative to the detector.  Do each detector individually.  For both polarizations.
%	\item Assemble the (simulated) superratio asymmetry.  We'll compare it to data, and the $\chi^2$ from that comparison will be our figure of merit.  
%	\item We can make a whole 2D parameter space for different values of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$, and compare them all (via their superratio asymmetries) to the experimental data.  We get the ``best'' values of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$, where $\chi^2$ is minimized.
	\item We can do this whole thing again for simulated data sets with different values of parameters that we vary as systematics.  Note how the best values of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$ change when each of the systematics are varied.

\section{BB1 Radius, Energy Threshold, Agreement}
\label{section:bb1_systematics}
	%\\*
BB1 radius cut can help to eliminate scattered events.  Energy threshold selection and statistical agreement between BB1 detectors' energies only makes a small effect on results.  BB1 radius itself has a pretty big effect on the result, but we can at least just G4 it away.  The remaining systematic effect is pretty small.  
\note[color=jb]{JB:  I hope the discussion is clear in your head.  Any effect that relies on scattering computation in G4 should have an uncertainty on order 10\% of the correction -- hopefully you are keeping a distinction here between the finite geometry acceptance (which I guess is exact) scattering off the collimator.}

\note[color=jb]{JB on missing figure:  ``if you used such an image as part of your uncertainty estimate, yes [include it]''}

\note{Remember:  There's noise applied to simulated BB1s, matching some spectrum.}
In the end, we get our results from the scintillator energy only, without summing the BB1 energy back in.  Energy absorbed in DSSDs is only used as (a) a tag for events, and (b) contributing to the total beta energy loss before the beta arrives at the scintillator.

%	\subsection{Motivation}
%	This process is used because the (back-)scatter, which it itself an important systematic, is largely independent of a wide variety of other experimental effects.  These other effects must all be evaluated, but it is computationally prohibitive to re-evaluate the scattering with every other effect under consideration.
	
	\subsection{What is it and how does it work?}
	Mono-energetic beta decay events are generated in GEANT4, which outputs an energy spectrum for unscattered and forward-scattered beta events in the detector.  These spectra are fit to a function to model the scintillator resolution, as well as energy loss in materials that the beta passed through before arriving at the scintillator.  These spectrum fits are performed for a set of beta energies, and parameters are extrapolated to be applied to betas emitted at intermediate energies.  Thus, the whole spectrum can be modeled.  Pictures will make this clearer.

\comment{
This subsection has the collaboration's evaluation of the uncertainty from
the scintillator detector's lineshape tail.
The energy from a monoenergetic beta is not always fully absorbed
in a plastic scintillator.
Although most backscattered betas are vetoed by the DSSD,
some produce bremsstrahlung photons,
and these frequently escape low-Z plastic scintillator-- all cross-sections
are known to high accuracy, but there is always uncertainty entailed in  the
MC implementation.
This lineshape tail will then effectively move events from higher to lower measured
energy, artificially altering the lower-energy asymmetries and mimicking the effects of a
Fierz term.

Since this detector effect is difficult to disentangle from the other scattering
effects off volumes,
the collaboration adds a linear function down to zero for the tail to
a Gaussian for the peak,
with linewidth varying by photon statistics~\cite{clifford}.
The convolution of this simple detector response function with v/c then scales the
centroid MC, with the lineshape tail varied by $\pm$10\% of its value,
a generic uncertainty accepted by the community for MC electromagnetic simulations.
The fit $b_{\rm Fierz}$ centroid changes by $\pm$ 0.0076, summarized
as the 0.008 ``Low Energy Tail'' in the systematics table at the start of this chapter.
Compared to other uncertainties of the present data set,
this is small enough that the accuracy of this estimate is adequate.
