\section{Background and Motivation}
The nuclear weak force is one of four fundamental forces described within physics.  It mediates the process of beta decay, which is of particular interest to us here.  Although beta decay is generally well understood, it presents a unique opportunity to search for physics beyond the Standard Model within the behaviour of the weak coupling.  By observing the kinematics and angular correlations involved in the decay process, one gains access to a wealth of information about the precise form of the operators mediating the decay.  

According to the predictions of the Standard Model, beta decay involves only so-called vector (V) and axial-vector (A) couplings, with a relative phase angle producing the left-handed ``(V--A)'' form of the interaction.  \aside{Did I even get this right?  Is the phase angle really what makes it left-handed?} There exists an extensive body of experimental evidence to demonstrate that this is overall a very good description of the beta decay process.  \aside{Cite a bunch of people here.  (Who?)  Might be nice to have a picture also.}  Despite the success of the (V--A) model, the additional presence of certain other ``exotic'' couplings cannot be entirely ruled out, and we shall be interested especially in scalar (S) and tensor (T) couplings.  \note{ According to present limits, these couplings would have to be pretty small relative to the (V) and (A) couplings.}

\bluetodo{Need to figure out how the exotic couplings actually work, mathematically.  What the fuck does ``$(V-A)$'' even *mean*?  IIRC John wants a brief mention of $\gamma_5$'s and $\gamma_\mu$'s, and probably a brief mention of whatever mumble-mumble group is mumble-mumble represented or something.}

\section{Exotic Couplings}
%	In particular, we're interested in so-called scalar and tensor couplings within the nuclear weak force. Standard model beta decay involves only vector and axial-vector couplings, combined with a ``$(V-A)$'' handedness (left-handed).  

\section{Fierz Interference -- The Physical Signature}
	The physical effects resulting from the presence of scalar or tensor couplings include a small perturbation to the energy spectrum of betas produced by radioactive decay.  

\missingfigure{I need that simulated picture of the different beta energy spectra, with different values of $\bFierz$.}

\section{Present Limits}
	A bit about other people's physics.

\section{A Toy Experiment}
	A quick overview of how an experiment like this one would be set up to extract the physics of interest, to keep the reader from getting too lost in the rest of the thesis.
\note{Do I really even *want* to include a toy experiment?  And would I want to do it here??  What even is the point?  I think in the past I decided it was easier to build up a description of .... something .... starting this way.  But why??  Possibly as I continue to add content, it will become obvious again why I originally wanted to do this.}
