\chapter{Background and Motivation}
\label{background_chapter}

\section{Exotic Couplings}
	In particular, we're interested in so-called scalar and tensor couplings within the nuclear weak force. Standard model beta decay involves only vector and axial-vector couplings, combined with a ``$(V-A)$'' handedness (left-handed).  
%\missingfigure{Make a sketch of the structure of a trebuchet.}

\section{Fierz Interference -- The Physical Signature}
	The physical effects resulting from the presence of scalar or tensor couplings include a small perturbation to the energy spectrum of betas produced by radioactive decay.  

\missingfigure{I need that simulated picture of the different beta energy spectra, with different values of $\bFierz$.}

\section{Present Limits}
	A bit about other people's physics.

\section{A Toy Experiment}
	A quick overview of how an experiment like this one would be set up to extract the physics of interest, to keep the reader from getting too lost in the rest of the thesis.
\note{Do I really even *want* to include a toy experiment?  And would I want to do it here??  What even is the point?  I think in the past I decided it was easier to build up a description of .... something .... starting this way.  But why??  Possibly as I continue to add content, it will become obvious again why I originally wanted to do this.}
