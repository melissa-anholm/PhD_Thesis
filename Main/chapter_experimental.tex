\chapter{The Experimental Setup}

\section{Overview}
The TRIUMF Neutral Atom Trap (TRINAT) offers an experimental set-up which is uniquely suited to precision tests of Standard Model beta decay physics.  Radioactive ions are delivered from the ISAC beamline and neutralized before being trapped in the first of two magneto-optical traps (MOTs).  Approximately once per second, atoms from the first MOT are transferred to the second, where their decay products can be observed with significantly less background than would have been possible in the first trap (see Figure~\ref{fig:doublemot}).  The transfer methodology is discussed in some detail in a paper by Swanson et al~\cite{swanson}. \aside{The point is that this eliminates background from the decays of other stuff.  Or the same stuff.  Stuff that's not centered at the trap.}

\end{figure}

Once the newly transferred atoms -- in this case, neutral $^{37}\textrm{K}$ -- have arrived at the second trap, the MOT cycles 500 times between a state where it is `on' and actively confining atoms to a region of approximately 2\,mm$^3$, to a state where it is `off' and instead the atoms are spin-polarized by optical pumping while the atom cloud expands ballistically before being re-trapped.  In order to eliminate systematic effects, the polarization direction is flipped every 16 seconds.  This optical pumping technique and its results are the subject of a recent publication~\cite{ben_OP}.

The science chamber (shown in Figure \ref{fig:thechamber}) operates at ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and provides the apparatus necessary to intermittently confine atoms within a MOT and then spin-polarize them, and quantify their position, temperature, and initial polarization, and electrostatic hoops to allow for collection and observation of charged recoiling daughter nuclei, as well as further detectors to observe the outgoing betas and reconstruct angular correlations.

Although the $\beta^+$ is charged, it is also highly relativistic and escapes the electric field with minimal perturbation.

The current-carrying copper Helmholtz coils and two beta telescopes are visible at the top and bottom.  The metallic piece near the center is one of the electrostatic `hoops' used to generate an electric field within the chamber.  The hoop's central circular hole allows access to the microchannel plate, and the two elongated holes on the sides allow the MOT's trapping lasers to pass unimpeded at an angle of 45 degress `out of the page'.]

\section{AC-MOT and Polarization Setup}
	%\\*
	In order to facilitate a measurement of $A_{\mathrm{\beta}}$, we went to great efforts to polarize the atom cloud, and quantify that polarization.  This resulted in a duty cycle in which the atoms were intermittently trapped in the AC-MOT, then optically pumped to polarize them.  While knowledge of the polarization is less critical in a measurement of $b_{\mathrm{Fierz}}$, we still use only the polarized portion of the duty cycle in order to minimize other systematic errors, such as the scintillator energy calibration and overall trap position.

	Anyway, here's some figures.  Or possibly one figure.  Whatever.  Also, here's a reference to a figure.  See Fig.~\ref*{fig:themot}, or also its subfigures, eg Fig.~\ref{fig:acmot} and Fig.~\ref{fig:mot}.  Maybe I have to subref them?  Like, eg, Subfig.~\subref{fig:acmot} and Subfig.~\subref*{fig:mot}.  What if we try to subref everything?  Consider, eg, Fig.~\subref{fig:themot}.

\section{Measurement Geometry and Detectors}
	%\\*
	Needs several diagrams.  Back-to-back beta detectors along the polarization axis.  Back-to-back MCPs in an electric field to tag events from the trap, and to measure the trap position and polarization.  Hoops to produce the electric field.  Many laser ports to make the MOT functional, and for optical pumping.  Fancy mirror geometry to combine optical pumping and trapping light along the vertical axis.  Water-cooled (anti-)Helmholz coils within the chamber for the AC-MOT, fast switching to produce an optical pumping field.
