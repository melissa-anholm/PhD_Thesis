Hi Melissa,
\\...\\
Attached is the report by Georg. I contains many valid points, and even for those where I'm not fully on board, it's clear that this has to be addressed. To be clear: This is not really that big of a deal. The actual work is not questioned in any way, and that's of course the really relevant part in the end. But it does have to be framed within a context, especially for the non-experts. I should have probably called off things like the handwritten appendix earlier, but thought that the committee members would ask for that in passing (on the basis that everything in the thesis must stand on its own, which those personal notes arguably don't; if this is relevant, it should be typed up).
\\...\\
I will write to the other committee members and call off their effort on this version, because Georg already won't sign off on it, so there is not point for them to go through it, as they most likely will agree with his points.
\\...\\
The course of action will now be for you to address these issues and then we'll resubmit.

\note[gg, nolist]{
...\\
I'm not entirely sold myself on a full "Standard Model intro" in the sense that the beta decay work stands on its own, and can be told as its own story. This is reflected by the fact that JTW predates the SM is is still fully relevant. So I'd go a somewhat light SM exposure. The most important goal is to make the non-experts comfortable in introducing what this is all about.
\\...\\
This will also bolster the citation count, which indeed looks suspiciously low (even though i'm not keen on such bean counting arguments).

hi Melissa,
\\
Gerald will soon send good clear corrections from a committee member. It will be clear you need to address those, and it will be clear what to do.
\\
Please read those first, and start answering them. Maybe then (and only then!) you will find two suggestions useful:

\\
i) Among the necessary technical corrections, there's a solid request for more background info. I think you know what to do.
\\...\\
A large thing is some kind of extra qualitative description of what the SM is. You could do that qualitatively without any trouble.
\\...\\
You might point out some part of this:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the charged weak interaction you're writing down predates the Weinberg-Salam model by more than a decade. The version you've written down assumes protons and neutrons are fundamental particles.
	\item The exchange boson is much heavier in mass than the energy and momentum in the decay, so it can be approximated by an interaction with zero range. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fermi did that very early on, 
		\item and Gamow and Teller added a process that change the nucleon spin. 
		\item Lee and Yang, which you cite, added the possible currents with different Lorentz transformations (do you mention that since any further combination of Dirac matrices can be reduced to these, so they span the space), and the possibility of parity violation by writing out helicity projections for the leptons. I.e. Lee and Yang assumed some fields (the nucleons and leptons) and a general interaction preserving the symmetries of the theory, which by definition is then an effective field theory.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Feynman and Gell-Mann's 1958 paper is the one that postulated V-A, again a decade before Weinberg-Salam, and they did this by making analogies between the boson exchanged and the photon, i.e. an analogy between the charged weak interaction and the electromagnetic current, so you could cite them instead of saying "SM predicts everything"
\end{itemize}
People had assumed there was a massive boson exchanged for a very long time.
\\
What Weinberg (and, independently, Salam) did was come up with a consistent mathematical theory of massive bosons, incorporating Yang Mills gauge theory (looks like E\&M but with nonabelian operators) to do that, and the result was the weak neutral interaction prediction.
}

\note[moved, nolist]{
ii) Similarly, answering how the results fit into the bigger picture is what you wanted to do.
\\...\\
I'm convinced that you don't want to do a full review of all beta decay experiments.
\\...\\
But you could say the Fierz term has been constrained by the energy spectrum and by the energy dependence of the beta
asymmetry, cite the best paper in the neutron and maybe the UCNA one as well, and use that figure I sent (I'm sending the improved version).
\\...\\
It is a good approximation to linearize the situation, i.e. this figure is good for small Cs and Ct. (A similar approach is being used in a letter coming out soon, and 3 referees did not nag them about it.)

That one figure with the $C_S$, $C_T$ used to be here.  But it's gone now.

\note[moved, nolist]{Immediate follow-up email from John:  
\\...\\
another basic big point. What would it mean if there were nonzero Cs, Ct? 
\\
In the context of the more elegant SM, a theory of quarks and leptons and mathematically consistent interactions, that would imply the existence of at least one extra unknown exchange boson. The mass would not be measured, just its coupling
strenghts to the particles participating in the beta decay.
\\...\\
Maybe background to understand that includes:
\\
If one were to write the SM weak interaction, $C_A$ and $C_V$ and $C_A$ and $C_V g_A$ would all be constants with abs value 1.
The (1+- gamma\_5)'s are projection operators-- in the SM, the W boson only couples to left-handed nu's and right-handed antinu's
\\
('more will be said in the forward-looking Ch. 6.2 about tests of that part.)
\\
So all the known information about Ca and Cv is accounted for.
\\
($g_A = 1.26$ for the neutron... it's not equal to 1 because of strong interactions between the quarks in the neutron.)

Re: Melissa Anholm, Ph.D. thesis, version April 18, 2022
\\
In response to your request for pre-evaluation of Melissa Anholm’s Ph.D. thesis, dated April 18, 2022, I believe that the thesis in its current form is \emph{not} ready for distribution.
}
\note[gs, nolist]
{
In my view, the following are critical problems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1. The thesis in its current form is completely missing any embedding into a “bigger picture”.
    This would be the task of the Introduction chapter primarily, but should also significantly permeate other parts such as, notably, the conclusions. One could phrase this in the form of questions, including – but certainly not limited to – the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item - What is the Standard Model?
        \item - Why are we even searching for “physics beyond the standard model”? Why is there a need or desire to do so?
        \item - What other efforts have been or are being made to search for physics beyond the standard model? Have any of them been successful? If so – or if not, what does this mean?
        \item - Closely related to the previous question, how does the current work fit into this overall effort? What is the unique contribution here?
	\end{itemize}
    Etc.

%%%...\\

    \item 2. These aspects should be picked up in the Conclusions. What do the results mean for the “big
    picture”? Again, how do the fit in with the other efforts, prior, concurrent, or planned? Etc.
\end{enumerate}
}
\note[moved, nolist]{
\begin{enumerate}    
	\setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item 3. As an outsider, it is my understanding that the author worked as part of a larger collaboration.
    It would be beneficial to clearly lay out what her unique contributions are. This could be
    done, for instance, in the Introduction, and/or the Conclusions.

\note[gs, nolist]{
\begin{enumerate}    
	\setcounter{enumi}{3}
    \item 4. Formulas and symbols contained in these need to be defined, as do symbols that appear in the
    text. Currently, this is only done partly. It starts right at the beginning with Eq.~\ref{eq:betaplus_decay} (formerly 1.1) and continues throughout. Sure, one can of course guess the meaning of the symbols in Eq.~\ref{eq:betaplus_decay} – but one should not have to guess! – and this is certainly not true for later equations. (For instance, I have no idea about the meaning of most of the symbols in Eq.~\ref{equation:integrated_jtw_INTRODUCTION} (formerly 1.9), to give but one example.)

}
\note[gs, nolist]{
\begin{enumerate}    
	\setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item 5. Similarly, several figures need better explanations, starting with Fig. 1.1. Which, btw., also needs a source attribution (unless it was created by the author) and, presumably, a copyright note. Similar comments apply to various other figures as well.
\end{enumerate}
}
\note[moved, nolist]{
\begin{enumerate}    
	\setcounter{enumi}{5}
    \item 6. At first glance, I find a bibliography that contains only 28 entries to be problematic for a Ph.D. thesis. This goes, to some degree, back to my earlier points about embedding the work in the “bigger picture” – doing so would necessarily lead to several additional references – but it might be more than that.
\end{enumerate}
}
\note[done, nolist]{
\begin{enumerate}    
	\setcounter{enumi}{6}
    \item 7. Appendix C, adding scanned pictures of handwritten notes as figures that, moreover, seem not to be referenced at all, is – well – problematic. I don’t think that it conforms to the instructions as per Supplemental Regulations either (though I did not explicitly check).
\end{enumerate}
}
\note[gs, nolist]{
\\...\\
Given these various issues, I have not fully read the thesis in detail; I have instead focused on the question at hand: what is needed for the thesis to be in a form that can be distributed? I will provide a more formal report on the version of the thesis that I will receive from FGS.
\\...\\
Besides, there are some additional points that I would suggest for modification but that do not, in my mind, prevent distribution. These include:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item 8. The abstract in its current form comprises 186 words or so. The FGS regulations allow for
    350 words maximum; I would encourage the author to make better use of that space – not the
    least in light of my earlier comments regarding the “big picture” and such.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}

\note[done, nolist]{Suggestions from John on listing my contributions that need to be mentioned and/or general stuff that needs to be mentioned:
\\
Georg wants you to list your contributions in the intro, good.
}

\note[moved, nolist]{First, in Section 2.4 the sentence after Harvey and Murray are referenced could be "There are some details of the present implementation of the AC MOT in Ref.~\cite{thesis}, done with a separate MOT geometry from
this beta decay work."
\\
(Presently your thesis is Ref. 14, which is only cited so far for Fig. 2.1)
\\...\\
*you need a subsection in Section 2.4 "The AC-MOT and Polarization" on your field trimming.
\\...\\
Time-constant ambient fields were trimmed in all dimensions using two horizontal pairs of Helmholtz coils and the AC MOT coils for the vertical direction.
These ambient B fields were first trimmed to be near zero using a giant magnetoresistance 3-axis probe at the trap center, with the MCP assembly removed and the vacuum chamber up to air.
\\...\\
Final trimming was done by optimizing polarization of stable $^{41}$K atoms with the apparatus assembled (cite[Fenker PRL Suppl Mat] has some details).
}
\note[moved, nolist]{The AC MOT and polarization B fields were generated by SRS DS345 arbitrary waveform generators, amplified by
Matsusada bipolar 20 KHz bandwidth 80A 20V amplifiers. The waveforms were carefully trimmed in amplitude and time to minimize B fields from eddy currents during the optical pumping cycle, again with the MCP assembly removed and the vacuum chamber up to air.
\\...\\
The bipolar amplifier bandwidth was inadequate when using current control mode, so voltage control had to be used, a much more time-exacting process requiring empirical iteration. These waveforms are not the same for the top and bottom coils, as during the optical pumping cycle one coil had to be flipped with respect to the MOT cycle to create the uniform vertical field for optical pumping by a Helmholtz rather than antiHelmholtz configuration.
\\
The beta detector full assemblies were in place during the field trimming.
\\...\\
All materials near the trap cloud are chosen to minimize both magnetic permeability to suppress time-constant B field gradients and conductivity to suppress eddy currents. E.g., the E field electrodes are made from either glassy carbon semiconductor or titanium alloy. A copper ring (not pictured in Fig. 2.5) with a slit mounted on each beta detector stainless steel reentrant flange suppresses the worst eddy currents fighting the B field along the z-axis. These designs were all confirmed by finite element calculations of another collaboration member.
}


\note[moved, nolist]{
I think you've neglected where the fT value and prediction for Abeta come from, entirely, and still don't have an equation for b\_Fierz in terms of Cs and Ct.
\\...\\
You had a note to do this, and in desperation I encouraged you to leave it out.
I was wrong and Georg is right-- the whole SM prediction for Abeta makes no sense this way, and something about it needs to be there.
\\...\\
there are two ways to add a dedicated section in ch 1:
\begin{itemize}
	\item i) by writing the equation for the rate in terms of Vud and rho (the G-T matrix element over Fermi squared), and saying Shidling et al. gets rho from that by assuming Vud from the 0+ to 0+ decays. (You had a note "Do the master equation!" which I think I said you needed to leave out, but I was probably wrong.) But then you have to define all the small corrections, which is a lot of physics.
	\item ii) Write the SM equation for Abeta in terms of rho, to give you the SM prediction for Abeta. State that recoil order corrections are in Appendix X. (If that's now a collaboration note? cite that there are recoil corrections considered in Appendix X-1 and a collaboration note).
	\item iii) Such a section would then naturally end with b\_Fierz in terms of Cs and Ct, a natural followup to what you've written.
	\\
"JTW does the Dirac matrix traces necessary to write down the decay rates in term of the Lee-Yang Lagrangian's parameters.
The prediction for b\_Fierz is " " which is zero in the SM." \textbf{even with recoil-order corrections} (there is no recoil order correction with the same m/Ebeta dependence).
\\
Then and only then will the final addition of the bFierz plot will make sense.
\end{itemize}
%
OR, more likely:
\\
\textbf{leave out i)}.
\\
Say in text that Shidling et al. (I've added the reference in a sticky note for the figure) hands you rho (the $M_{GT}/M_F$ ratio prediction) using as input the absolute rate, Vud from the 0+ to 0+ beta decays, and calculations of isospin mixing and radiative corrections (cite[shidling]) for details beyond the scope of this thesis. The sign of rho comes both from a shell model by Ian and by if it were flipped Abeta would be off by an enormous factor. 
\\...\\
Then you would just need \textbf{ii and iii}.
}
\note[jbn, nolist]{
As a reward for reading this far, I'll admit I wrote the bFierz m/E dependence wrong in the sticky notes in ch 1, sorry.
}

%%%
\note[moved, nolist]{first, actually, Ben writes a good summary of Ft mirror equation in terms of Ft0+ to 0+ in the PRL, you could just use that in Ch. 1 and it would help enormously. (Of course now I'm scared because it doesn't mention isospin mixing is different for 37K and the others, and that should be in the numerator as (Ft0to0/Ft37K) well as in rho, shouldn't it? I would need to compare to Shidling's expressions to sort this out.)
}
\note[moved, nolist]{
I said Ft wrong. I think you must know what to do.  
\\
F is the lepton phase space integral.
\\
(Decay rate)/F is then a dimensionless quantity proportional to |matrix element|$^2$, which you could call the intrinsic strength of the transition.
\\
People instead consider the inverse quantity denoted Ft defined as F*t\_1/2, so if log\_10(Ft) is smaller, the strength is larger.
\\...\\
So e.g. t\_1/2 is wildly different for the 0+ to 0+ decays (t1/2 for $^{14}$O is a minute, not a second like 38mK) but once you correct for the wildly different phase space (the Coulomb energies and therefore the decay Q-value smoothly grow, and phase space goes like $Q^5$) the Ft rates are close (closer once percent corrections from isospin mixing and nucleus-dependent radiative corrections are applied).
}
\note[moved, nolist]{
...
\\
(That equation is fine-- I was confused earlier.) You can mention that script{Ft} has isospin-breaking and other theory corrections beyond the scope of the thesis, and cite Shidling for those. This equation, along with the Abeta equation in terms of rho (you should not include the right-handed currents in Ben's Abeta equation and re-state that your thesis is working on scalar and tensor in your title) then sets up the inputs you need for the Abeta prediction.

\\
all of these are trivial....

\begin{itemize}
\item *section 2.1.3 "using a Helmoltz coil" add "but with currents in opposite direction." (saying it correctly here then implicitly defines anti-Helmholtz which you use correctly later for the AC MOT)

\note[moved, nolist]{Chapter 2 corrections from John: (trivial...):
\\...\\
*2.5.1 state clearly in an extra paragraph at the end that the polarization-determining data was taken with the rMCP, while the Abeta and bFierz data were taken with the eMCP. The polarization was assumed to be the same during the Abeta+bFierz data. This is backed up by constant 41K polarization data for weeks
of optimization, with all optical pumping and B field switching parameters kept constant. Ambient magnetic field changes of 50 milliGauss could cause some polarization perturbations at the precision achieved, yet the stray fields are under control at that level. The TRINAT lab is in a basement well-shielded from the experimental hall by concrete with rebar, and though 50 mG fields are seen in that Hall from an open Helmholtz ion trap, they and the 5-ton crane produce negligible fields when measured at the atom trap. The cyclotron field makes 0.5 Gauss, predominantly vertical, and a smaller horizontal component, but trim Helmholtz coils at TRINAT are adjusted during calibrations with cyclotron on vs. off, and of course the cyclotron is on with constant field during the 37K delivery.
}
\note[moved, nolist]{a glaring omission:
\\
\textbf{You don't state the polarization achieved 99.1$\pm$0.1 percent anywhere that I can see., citing the publication.} You might also state that's important for Abeta but has much more precision than needed for the near-zero bFierz term.

You mention the polarization is different by approximately 0.3\% in Section 6.1 from the cut, but never say what P is.

Appendix A has ?? for a discussion of the changes of the polarization cut, so you need to clean up that \ref{}. It is presently in Section 6.1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\note[moved, nolist]{Another Round of Thoughts from John!
\\...\\
Fitting Ben's data (using for the bFierz function my convolution of 1/E with a Clifford tail) as I've shown before, compare what happens if I let Abeta float, or if I then fix Abeta arbitrarily to that floated value.
\\
That's not a well-motivated thing to do on its own, but it's not that much different than using Abeta[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] constrained by Ft[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] since that's only dependent on squares of small quantities.
\\...\\
So I would expect the ability to extract Cs and Ct from the 37K data to have more
sensitivity if Abeta[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] and Ft[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] and bFierz[Cs,Ct] are floated together in a 2d fit rather then floating Abeta and bFierz without any theoretical constraints and then considering getting linear combinations of Cs and Ct from the bFierz value.
\\...\\
Note that my simply fixing Abeta lowers bFierz uncertainty by a factor of 3. I expect similar improvement in sensitivity to Cs and Ct.
\\...\\
(Here I'm using Cs as a stand-in for (Cs+Cs')/2 for simplicity)

\note[moved, nolist]{More thoughts from John:
\\...\\
hi Melissa,
\\...\\
I think you should keep Section 6.2, but I think it would be clearer to point out the observable manifests as a dip in the raw TOF spectrum, not going all the way to zero as in the ideal on-axis situation you describe for simplicity.
I.e., I would say you need to qualify this "exactly" word (emphasis mine below), and since
it ends up as a cos(theta) distribution like in my attached slide on the subject, your figure of the TOF spectrum would be a good way to do that.
\\...\\
"Henceforth, daughter nuclei from a back-to-back decay as shown in
Figure ?? will be described as ‘slow’ recoils. In terms of observables, this means that
if the electric field is configured to point along one of the axes perpendicular to the
polarization direction, then when the recoiling ion is swept away into a detector, the
slow recoil’s hit position should be \textbf{exactly}​​ along the projection of the polarization
axis. Furthermore, the slow recoil’s time of flight should be in the middle of the time
of flight spectrum, since other recoils will be emitted with momentum towards or
away from the detector"

The SM couples to left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. Since the neutrinos only have weak interactions, there are no right-handed nu's nor left-handed antinu's in nature. The neutrino asymmetry $B_\nu$ is a number with no energy dependence.

Similarly, the SM weak interaction only couples to right-handed positrons and left-handed electrons. Since these are massive particles, the average helicity of positrons is not 1, but instead v/c.

$\bFierz$ = 0.017 $\pm$ 0.021, consistent with the Standard Model prediction of zero.
Our measurement is strongly related, yet complementary.
In terms on non-Standard Model Lorentz current structures, to lowest order in the non-SM  currents the same equation applies:
\\
$\bFierz$ = $\pm$ $(C_S +C_S' + (C_T - C_T') \lambda^2)/( 1 + \lambda^2)$
\\
(the plus is for $\beta^-$ decay and the - for $\beta^+$ decay)~\cite{jtw}.  [to be continued...] }
\note[moved, nolist]{[...continued from prev.]
\\
In our $^{37}$K case, $\lambda^2$ = $|M_{\rm GT}|^2$/$|M_{\rm F}|^2$ is close to 3/5 (the expected value j/(j+1) for a single j=3/2 d3/2 nucleon)~\cite{deShalit1963},
while for the neutron $\lambda^2$ is close to 3 (the expected value for an (j+1)/j j=1/2 s1/2 nucleon).
$|M_F|$, the Fermi matrix element, is nearly the same for both of these isospin = 1/2 decays (the largest correction is the larger isospin mixing of $\sim$0.01 in $^{37}$K).
So our observable is relatively less sensitive to Lorentz tensor currents, and will predominantly constrain or discover Lorentz scalar currents.
\\...\\ 
Full considerations would require a weighted fit of $\bFierz$ experiments and similar observables~\cite{Falkowski2021}, and are beyond the scope of this thesis.
The info from this thesis, values of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$ with their uncertainties, can together with the known $fT$ value (lifetime and
branching ratio) allow the community and/or the collaboration to include the results in a future constraint or discovery of scalar and tensor Lorentz currents
contributing to $\beta$ decay.}

%%%%%Within the present understanding of physics, there are four fundamental forces governing the interactions of particles with one another:  electromagnetism, the nuclear weak force, the nuclear strong force, and gravity. 
%%%%%%
%%%%%Among other things, these four forces are considered distinct by virtue of the fact that each one couples to a different type of charge and is mediated by a different type of particle.  The result is that each force has potentially different behaviour at varying length scales.  
%%%%%%
%%%%%The most familiar example of this is a comparison between the forces of electromagnetism and gravity.  While the electromagnetic force couples to both positive and negative electric charges, and can therefore create both attractive and repulsive forces, the gravitational force couples only to (positive) mass, and the result is a force that is only attractive and never repulsive.  Both forces are mediated by massless particles (the photon and graviton, respectively), which implies that the strength of the two forces must fall off at the same rate as the distance between interacting bodies is increased.  In the case of the nuclear weak force, the mediator particles are massive, ...

%A nucleus undergoing beta decay converts one of its protons (neutrons) into a neutron (proton), and simultaneously emits a lepton and anti-lepton.  The daughter nucleon remains bound in place of its parent, and the overall electric charge of the nucleus is changed by -1 (+1), with the extra charge being carried away by the anti-lepton (lepton).  In particular, at the nucleon level, three beta decay processes are possible:
%\bea
%	p &\rightarrow& n + e^+ + \nu_e        \label{eq:betaplus_decay} \\
%	n &\rightarrow& p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e, \label{eq:betaminus_decay}  \\
%	p + e^- &\rightarrow& n + \nu_e        \label{eq:electroncapture}
%\eea
%where the processes described in Eqs.~\ref{eq:betaplus_decay} and~\ref{eq:electroncapture} are energetically disallowed for an unbound proton, however there is no similar requirement for Eq.~\ref{eq:betaminus_decay}.
~\aside[jbn]{Eqs. ~\ref{eq:betaplus_decay} and ~\ref{eq:electroncapture} are energetically disallowed for an unbound proton, but allowed energetically when bound in nuclei as in 37K decay.}

}
Limiting the focus of this discussion to Eq.~\ref{eq:betaplus_decay}, we note that this expression provides no information at all about the momenta or spin of the outgoing daughter particles.  This behaviour is governed by the form of the Weak coupling that mediates the decay.  

Within the field of nuclear physics, it is common to classify beta decay processes as being either ``Allowed'' or ``Forbidden''~\aside[jbn]{don't capatalize "Allowed" and "Forbidden."
The quotes are justified.} (sometimes with an associated number to describe the extent to which it is Forbidden), where Forbidden processes are generally suppressed but not truly forbidden.  In an Allowed transition, the positron and anti-neutrino are treated as being created at the nuclear centre, and as a result they may not carry away any \emph{orbital} angular momentum.  However, since the outgoing leptons both have spin $S=1/2$, it is still possible for the total nuclear angular momentum, $J$, to be changed in an Allowed decay.  This implies that an Allowed transition must \emph{always} change the total nuclear angular momentum by either $0$ or $\pm1$.  
~\note[jbn]{First forbidden decay emits leptons with total orbital angular momentum 1, changing the nuclear parity-- suppressed in a long-wavelength approximation ~ ((beta momentum)/(hbar c))$^2$ or about two orders of magnitude. This is one reason decays to negative-parity excited states of 37K are so small (Fig.~\ref{fig:nuclearleveldiagram}).
}

The Allowed decays traditionally are further separated into a Fermi singlet~\aside[jbn]{singlet in lepton spin} in which there is no change to nuclear angular momentum ($\Delta J = 0$) and therefore the two leptons are required to have anti-parallel spins, and a Gamow-Teller triplet~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006}, where the projection of the nuclear angular momentum is changed by $\pm1$.%, and so the two lepton spins must be aligned in parallel to one another under the Allowed approximation.
\note[done]{My only comment is to ask where the Fermi "singlet" and "triplet" came from, referring to coupling of the lepton spins.
\\
I have not seen this-- it could be fine, yes, I don't know.}

This implies that the total nuclear angular momentum is changed by $\Delta J = \{0, \pm1\}$ during a Gamow-Teller transition.  A mixed transition is also possible, however we note that the $J_i = J_f = 0$ decays must always be pure Fermi transitions, because there is no way to produce this result from two outgoing leptons with parallel spins.~\cite{krane}~\cite{wong1990}~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006}.

Given the differing behaviour within the angular momenta of the daughters in Fermi and Gamow-Teller transitions, it is perhaps not suprising that that the \emph{linear} momenta of the outgoing particles should also follow a different set of distributions in these two cases.  At the level of the Weak~\aside[jbn]{Don't capitalize Weak anywhere, either. You can keep quotes around the first "weak", I guess.} coupling, Fermi- and Gamow-Teller~\aside[jbn]{you should indeed capitalize Fermi and Gamow-Teller because these are people.} transitions are governed by different operators, with the Fermi interaction mediated by a so-called ``vector'' ($V$) coupling, and the Gamow-Teller interaction mediated by an ``axial-vector'' ($A$) coupling.
~\note[jbn]{The vector and axial-vector couplings refer to Lorentz transformation of the Lagrangian terms involved, which we come to next.}

%%%\section{On Modern Precision Measurements and the Nuclear Weak Force}
%%%\label{sec:modernprecision}
%%%Although the physics community has largely come to a consensus over the years about the \emph{dominant} behaviour of the nuclear weak force, there still exists a range of possible \emph{sub-dominant} behaviours that cannot be ruled out by theoretical considerations alone, and therefore must be tested experimentally.  With the weak force already so well described, searching for indications of unexpected behaviours is the domain of precision measurements.  This class of non-dominant behaviours is sometimes described as exotic physics, or with the imprecise label of physics \ac{BSM}, or even the wildly inaccurate misnomer, ``new physics''.  
%%%
%%%Many types of exotic physics have, in fact, already been described by Lee and Yang's 1956 interaction Hamiltonian, which was originally motivated by the question of parity conservation within beta decay\cite{LeeYang}.  Despite the original motivations, the authors were very thorough in their description of possible interaction types.  By starting with Fermi's contact interaction model of beta decay, incorporating Gamow and Teller's selection rules, and enforcing Lorentz invariance, they arrived at a nucleon-level Hamiltonian (quarks had not been discovered yet) which accounted for \emph{all} possible coupling behaviours~\cite{GamowTeller}. 
%%%%\aside{also cite Fermi here, and Gamow-Teller.}
%%%
%%%In the years since, we have discovered that beta decay is mediated by $W^\pm$ bosons, which, among other things, allows for the possibility of certain transitions (ie, with different selection rules) occuring, which had been considered forbidden under the contact interaction model.  
%%%%certain suppressed transitions with different selection rules
%%%%creates the opportunity for certain suppressed transitions to occur which follow different sets of selection rules.
%%%%thereby allowing for certain suppressed transitions with different sorts selection rules.  
%%%Since $W^\pm$ bosons are quite massive,
%%%%relative to typical beta decay energies,
%%%\aside{Give numbers.} the beta decay interaction is only applicable at a short range, and as a result, the Fermi model (with the Gamow-Teller addendum) represents a very good approximation for the transitions it applies to. \aside{Give numbers.}
%%%%So although Fermi's model with the Gamow-Teller addendum is not truly a complete description, it is still a very good approximation, given the mass of the  $W^\pm$ bosons relative to typical beta decay energies.
%%%\aside{Also, like many mathematical descriptions where one wants to predict things, it's better without the quarks.}
%%%%\note{This isn't quite right.  Gamow and Teller added a process to change nucleon spin, and the Lee-Yang Hamiltonian is based on that.}
%%%
%%%We begin with Fermi's\aside{Is this true?  Probably} description of the transition: 
%%%\bea
%%%\mathcal{M}_{fi} &=& G_F \int \bar{\psi}_f \, \mathcal{\hat{O}} \, \psi_i \,\textrm{d}V,% \;\;=\;\; \int \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}} \textrm{d}V
%%%\eea 
%%%where $\mathcal{M}_{fi}$ is the transition matrix element between the final ($\psi_f$) and initial ($\psi_i$) states, and $G_F$ gives a measure of the size of the coupling between states.  The integral is evaluated over phase space volume.  Equivalently, $\mathcal{M}_{fi}$ may be written in terms of the interaction Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}}$, as 
%%%\bea
%%%\mathcal{M}_{fi} &=& \int \! \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}} \, \textrm{d}V. 
%%%%\label{eq:transitionmatrixhamiltonian}
%%%\eea 
%%%%
%%%This leads immediately to Fermi's Golden Rule, 
%%%\beq
%%%\Gamma \;\; = \;\; \frac{1}{\tau}  \;\; = \;\; \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \left| \mathcal{M}_{fi} \right|^2 \, \rho(E_f),
%%%%\;\;\;\; \textrm{(Why is this formatted weird??)},
%%%\eeq
%%%which describes the relationship between the total transition rate $\Gamma$ (or equivalently the lifetime $\tau$), the transition matrix element $\mathcal{M}_{fi}$, and the available density of states at the final energy, $\rho(E_f)$.  We can also use this to write down the differential decay rate, 
%%%\bea
%%%\frac{\textrm{d}^5 \Gamma}{ \textrm{d} \Ebeta \textrm{d}\Omegahatbeta \textrm{d} \Omegahatnu }

%%%With this description, the problem of characterizing the transition is reduced to determining the form of $\mathcal{\hat{O}}$, or equivalently, $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}}$.  Table~\ref{table:dirac_matrix_operators} provides a comprehensive list of all operators for which Lorentz invariance holds.  The complete transition operator $\mathcal{\hat{O}}$ must be comprised of a linear combination of these terms.

%%%\input{equation_LeeYangHamiltonian.tex}%  \label{eq:lee_yang_hamiltonian} 
%%%
%%%Here, $C_X$ and $C_X^{\prime}$ (with $X=\{V,A,S,T,P\}$) are complex coupling constants for vector, axial, scalar, tensor, and pseudoscalar interactions, and $\psi_Y$ (with $Y=\{p,n,e,\nu\}$) are the wavefunctions for the interaction's proton, neutron, electron, and neutrino.  Operators $\gamma_5$ and $\gamma_\mu$ are Dirac gamma matrices, and $\mbox{$\sigma_{\lambda\mu} = -\frac{i}{2}(\gamma_\lambda \gamma_\mu - \gamma_\mu\gamma_\lambda )$}$.  As usual, ``H.C.'' represents the Hermitian conjugate of the previous terms within the Hamiltonian.
%%%%\aside{What about sigma!?  is it a pauli matrix?}  
%%%
%%%The fact that there are two coupling constants (primed and unprimed) for each type of coupling relates to the \emph{handedness} of the interaction.  Both left-handed and right-handed couplings, or a combination thereof, are \emph{a priori} possible, and the form of Eq.~\ref{eq:lee_yang_hamiltonian} does not give preference to either.
%%%
%%%
%%%While it is possible to define an interaction's handedness in a rigorous and mathematical way, the reader may gain more clarity by simply remembering the rule of thumb that a left-handed weak force 
%%%% (which is predominantly or entirely what exists in nature) 
%%%couples only to left-handed regular matter leptons and right-handed anti-leptons --- where the handedness of a lepton or other particle is defined by the direction of its spin relative to its direction of motion.  That description is exact in the limit where such a lepton travels at the speed of light (otherwise a clever Lorentz transform can change the result), but the underlying mathematics is well defined for slower particles as well.  For neutrinos, which are so light they were long believed to be massless, the description is \emph{nearly perfect}.  For electrons and positrons emitted in beta decay, which are massive but often emitted at relativistic speeds, the description is only \emph{pretty good}.

%%%OK.  This stuff is basically yoinked from Ben's thesis.  And Dan's.  I'll need to re-organize and rephrase the content -- but I want to make sure I get the important points down.  
%%%
%%%In 1931, Pauli figured out about neutrinos, because beta decay produced a whole spectrum of beta energies, so there had to be a third body available to carry off some of the energy.  (Dan doesn't cite anyone here)
%%%
%%%There's the matrix element, $\mathcal{M}_{fi}$, which connects the initial and final nuclear states, before and after an interaction (decay).  
%%%
%%%\bea
%%%\mathcal{M}_{fi} &=& \int \psi_f^* \mathcal{O} \psi_i \textrm{d}V  \;\;\;\; \textrm{(What is $V$??  Pretty sure it's phase space volume.)}, 
%%%\eea 
%%%which goes with Fermi's Golden Rule (or at least one of them):
%%%\bea
%%%\Gamma &= \;\; \frac{1}{\tau} \;\; =& \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \left| \mathcal{M}_{fi} \right|^2 \, \rho(E_f)  \;\;\;\; \textrm{(Why is this formatted weird??)},
%%%\eea
%%%where, as Ben puts it, $\rho(E_f)$ is "the thermodynamic density of states available at a final energy".  Then he writes down the differential decay rate and cites ~\cite{Fermi1934German} 
%%%%\cite{fermi1934english} 
%%%for it, which is in German:
%%%\bea
%%%\frac{\textrm{d}^5 W}{ \textrm{d} \Ebeta \textrm{d}\Omega_\beta \textrm{d}\Omega_\nu } 
%%%&=& \frac{G_F^2}{(2\pi)^5} \pbeta \Ebeta (E_0 - \Ebeta)^2 F_{\pm}(\Ebeta, Z^\prime) \left| \mathcal{M}_{fi} \right|^2
%%%\eea
%%%Anyway, that thing was published in 1934 !  And he assumed the interaction only worked at $0$ distance.  Also, he postulated that the weak force was a vector interaction, and some of it is!  
%%%
%%%Later, we collectivelly learned that a better model is to suppose that the interaction is mediated by a massive, charged $W^+$ or $W^-$ particle.  Also, it's pretty heavy, and Ben totally gives the mass so he can cite the dudes who compile that stuff, but there's a new version now.  As of 2018, we have $m_W = 80.379(12)$\,GeV/$c^2$ ~\cite{pdg2018}.  The point is, the fact that it's so massive means that the approximation of $0$ distance was pretty good, since the larger mass implies that the interaction can only occur at short range.
%%%
%%%So we're going to require that $\mathcal{O}$ must behave under a Lorentz transformation.  You can construct operators with the correct form out of Dirac $\gamma$-matrices, and you get scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, and tensor couplings.  potentially.  Anything else would just reduce to linear combinations of those, so those ones span the space.  Some of those respect parity, and some don't.  

%\input{table_dirac_matrix_operators.tex}

%%Up until 1956, it was common wisdom that weak interactions should respect parity, but there was really no evidence for it.  Lee and Yang formulate a more general description of beta decay, with all the Lorentz symmetry respecting operators, and only some of those obey parity~\cite{LeeYang}.  It was an open question, then, whether parity should be respected in the nuclear weak interaction -- but not for long, because C.S. Wu tested it out in 1957~\cite{wu}.  The result of the experiment is that not only is parity *not* conserved, it's (sometimes) *maximally* not conserved!  Neat!  Nobody would have expected it.
%%
%%Ben points out that they thought it was scalars and tensors at first, and cites some people(\cite{RustadRuby1955tensor}\cite{BurgyEpstein1957scalartensor}), but frankly, I can't access those articles and I thought there was more evidence for it than that.  Also, the one article is published before Madame Wu's, so idk what to make of that.

%%%%Ben points out that the $V-A$ form of the interaction means that parity is *maximally* violated, however he also says that $A$ has $+$ and $V$ has $-$ parity.
%%%%
%%%%Anyway.  We're maximally parity violating, and when we describe this in modern terminology, we would say that the $W^{\pm}$ particles only couple to negative helicity (left-handed) leptons, or positive helicity antimatter leptons (anti-leptons).
%%%%\note[bluetodo]{Wait.  Are these equivalent statements??  So confused...}
%%%%
%%%%Also, chirality as a concept.  It's an intuitively straightforward concept when your particle is going at the speed of light.  So, for a massless neutrino, if it has a negative chirality, that means that its spin vector is pointed opposite to its direction of motion.  
%%%%
%%%%Also-also, the fundamental property is chirality, not helicity.  Helicity can be flipped by a simple Lorentz boost.  But because we're talking about an interaction, there is some sense in which this defines a rest frame for us.   ....is this even the correct way to think about it?  I think it has to be fine.
%%%%
%%%%So anyway, we have lots of evidence for the $V-A$ form of interactions.  (Ben doesn't cite anyone for this).  But other forms of the interaction could be in there too.  And at this point, Ben just assumes the Standard Model and goes with it.

So e.g. t\_1/2 is wildly different for the 0+ to 0+ decays (t1/2 for $^{14}$O is a minute, not a second like 38mK) but once you correct for the wildly different phase space (the Coulomb energies and therefore the decay Q-value smoothly grow, and phase space goes like $Q^5$) the Ft rates are close (closer once percent corrections from isospin mixing and nucleus-dependent radiative corrections are applied).

I.e. Lee and Yang assumed some fields (the nucleons and leptons) and a general interaction preserving the symmetries of the theory, which by definition is then an effective field theory. \cite{LeeYang}

What Weinberg (and, independently, Salam) did was come up with a consistent mathematical theory of massive bosons, incorporating Yang Mills gauge theory (looks like E\&M but with nonabelian operators) to do that, and the result was the weak neutral interaction prediction.

\note{A paragraph that used to live in my "draft of the intro" section:
\\...\\
There exists an extensive body of experimental evidence to demonstrate that the above model is overall a very good description of the beta decay process~\cite{wu}.  Despite the success of the $(V-A)$ model, there are still certain lingering questions that must be addressed by precision measurements.  Any deviation from maximal parity violation (i.e., a ``$(V+A)$'' contribution to the Weak force) would be of great interest to the community, as would the presence of certain other exotic couplings, such as the so-called Scalar ($S$) and Tensor ($T$) interactions.  Any such behaviour beyond the Standard Model (BSM) would represent a non-dominant contribution to the interaction, however the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.

%%\greycomment{The nuclear Weak force is one of four fundamental forces described within physics.  It mediates the process of beta decay, which is of particular interest to us here.  Although beta decay is generally well understood, it presents a unique opportunity for precision measurements to search for physics beyond the Standard Model within the Weak coupling.  By observing the kinematics and angular correlations involved in the decay process, one gains access to a wealth of information about the form of the operators mediating the decay.}
%
%According to the predictions of the \acf{SM}, %Standard Model~\aside[jbn]{standard model} (SM), 
%the Weak force involves only vector ($V$) and axial-vector ($A$) couplings, where a relative sign within the quark-lepton Lagrangian produces the left-handed ``$(V-A)$'' form of the interaction in maximal violation of parity.  In terms of physical behaviour, one consequence of this model is that ``regular matter'' leptons emerge from a Weak interaction with left-handed chirality, while antimatter leptons emerge with right-handed chirality. Any deviation from this behavior would be indicative of ``new'' or ``exotic'' (i.e., not previously discovered) physics.

%%%%%%%	%\\*
%%%%%%%	%The Fermi description of beta decay can be found in any nuclear physics textbook, but you have to dig slightly harder to understand Gamow-Teller or mixed decays, all of which are relevant here.  
%%%%%%%%Beta decay within the Standard Model is well understood.  \greycomment{At the nucleon level, two processes are possible:
%%%%%%%%\bea
%%%%%%%%	p &\rightarrow& n + e^+ + \bar{\nu}_e  \label{eq:betaplus_decay} \\
%%%%%%%%	n &\rightarrow& p + e^- + \nu_e, \label{eq:betaminus_decay}
%%%%%%%%\eea
%%%%%%%%where Eq.~\ref{eq:betaplus_decay} is energetically disallowed for an unbound proton, however there is no similar requirement for Eq.~\ref{eq:betaminus_decay}.  
%%%%%%%%}
%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%\greycomment{We will limit the scope of this discussion to Allowed transitions, in which a beta decay may not change the \emph{orbital} angular momentum.  However, as the outgoing leptons have spin$=1/2$ and therefore carry angular momentum, the total nuclear angular momentum may still be changed.  Since a beta decay creates \emph{two} new leptons, this implies that the total nuclear angular momentum must always change by either $0$ or $1$ in an Allowed decay ~\cite{krane}.}
%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%only possible for a proton bound within a nucleus, 
%%%%%%%%not possible for an unbound proton.  
%%%%%%%%In the most basic sense, a beta decay involves a proton (neutron) within a nucleus (either within a nucleus or not) undergoes a transition to a neutron (proton), simultaneously creating a new positron (electron) and neutrino (anti-neutrino).  
%%%%%%%%	via Krane~\cite{krane}
%%%%%%%%	Under the Allowed Approximation, we require that a beta decay may not carry away any orbital angular momentum, because we treat the nucleus as pointlike \aside{Is this even true?  The pointlike thing?  ...No.  No it's not.} and work in the CM frame.  
%%%%%%%%	An Allowed decay can, however, change the total nuclear angular momentum, because the outgoing leptons have spin$=1/2$ and therefore carry angular momentum.  Therefore, in an allowed decay, the total nuclear angular momentum must always change by either $0$ or $1$.  
%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%	\note[jb1]{JB says:  The title of Holstein's review addresses this ``pointlike'' issue, and he describes the ``impulse approximation" in Section V.  The interaction is not pointlike, because all constants are a form factor expansion in $q^2$ -- finite size terms contribute to the Coulomb correction.}
%%%%%%%	
%%%%%%%	From a 2006 paper by Severijns et al ~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006}, the selection rules for an allowed transition are:
%%%%%%%\bea
%%%%%%%\Delta I = I_f - I_i = \{0, \pm 1\} \\ 
%%%%%%%\hat{\Pi}_i \, \hat{\Pi}_f = +1

%\note{Possible Supersection:  General Considerations of Atomic Techniques Used}
%\note[org]{I need to organize the sections/subsections in this chapter/section better, and generally just de-Frankenstein it.}


%\note{``In order to understand the mechanism by which a MOT is able to confine atoms, we must first introduce the Zeeman effect (Section ~\ref{sec:zeemansplitting}) and a description of an optical molasses (Section ~\ref{sec:dopplercooling}). A functional MOT combines the forces resulting from these two mechanisms to trap and cool atoms.''}

%The TRINAT lab has adopted this technique from atomic physics to perform nuclear physics experiments.  
%Such samples may subsequently be used in a variety of physical measurements.
%\note{``Since the magneto-optical trap (MOT) was first described in 1987 by Raab et. al.~\cite{raabprentiss}, it has become a standard technique for confining cold samples of neutral atoms.  These cold trapped atoms may subsequently be used in the measurement of a variety of physical quantities."}

%\note{Needs a level diagram.  Maybe.}
%
%The Zeeman shift is what happens when you stick an atom in a magnetic field.  An atom's energy levels, which would have been degenerate before applying a field, split according the angular momentum.  At low fields (which is what is of interest to us here), the energy perturbation scales linearly with the strength of the magnetic field.  

\note{
When this is combined with a circularly polarized laser beam, the effect is to move the atomic resonance closer to- or farther from- the frequency of the laser.  The circular polarization, combined with some selection rules, means a circularly polarized laser will only couple to one particular transition, w.r.t. angular momentum.  ie, for a $\sigma_+$ polarized laser, the atom's overall angular momentum projection (along some axis) will be incremented by $+1$.  The Zeeman shift means that in a magnetic field, this transition (M+=1) not be the same as the M-=1 transition.  So, if you have a magnetic field that changes linearly across space, you can make it so that in $+ B_z$ regions, the laser beam with one certain polarization is closer to resonance and therefore more likely to be absorbed -- and similarly, in $- B_z$ regions, a different laser with the opposite polarization will be more likely to be absorbed.  Again, if the B-field is linear in space, you can do it so that as the atoms get further and further from the `centre' region, the effect gets progressively stronger.  So, if you've done this right, you can make it so that the atoms get a stronger ``push'' back towards the center the farther away they've drifted.
\\
They still get the optical molasses cooling effect for free.}

%detuned slightly to the red of 

%constrained in the other two dimensions such that it must lie within the laser's path.  

%These pushes, however, which are moderated by photon absorption and emission, are all (nearly) the same size, so 


%within the atom's own frame of reference will bring the  
%We will suppose that both lasers are equally detuned slightly to the red of resonance.  Then, for an individual atom in motion relative to the lab frame, 
%Detuning the laser from resonance will of course decrease absorption upon interacting with an atom at rest -- however the atoms within the cloud are not at rest, but rather are undergoing thermal motion.  

%%%%Since the laser has been red-detuned within the lab frame, the blueshift moves the laser frequency as seen by the atom back toward resonance, and makes its photons more likely to be absorbed.  Similarly, for an atom moving in the same direction as a red-detuned laser beam, this laser will be seen as further red-shifted, and absorption likelihood is decreased.  Because of the difference in absorption, such an atom becomes more likely to receive a push back against its (lab frame) direction of motion, slowing it down, and less likely to recieve a push to increase its lab frame speed.   \aside{Optical molasses equation?  Maybe?}

%The overall effect on a one-dimensional cloud of atoms in the path of two counter-propagating red-detuned lasers is that the atoms will be slowed and cooled.  Such a setup is sometimes referred to as a one-dimensional ``optical molasses'' due to the viscous drag force induced on atomic motion.  It is straightforward to extend this model to three dimensions.  Although this setup will decrease atomic velocity, it does not include a confining force, so the atoms are still free to move out of the lasers' path, albeit at a decreased speed.  


%The laser's red detuning with respect to the atomic resonance 

%being used are of a sufficiently high intensity  
%\note{``Such a setup is sometimes referred to as a one-dimensional “optical molasses” due to the viscous drag force induced on atomic motion, which will be discussed in more detail shortly.''}
%\note{``In such a system, an incident photon can excite an atom from the ground state into the excited state, while simultaneously giving the atom a “push” proportional to the laser’s detuning from the atomic resonance.''}

%Consider an atom in one dimension in the midst of two counter-propagating laser beams which are otherwise identical.   ...Ugh.
%\note{Needs an equation. (?)}
%\note{Needs work.}
%\note[org]{I should really split these things back up into subsections.  Zeeman shift, saturation intensity, optical molasses/doppler cooling.  Then selection rules.}

%First, consider an atom in an optical molasses.  in 1D, that means there are two counter-propogating lasers, both tuned slightly to the red of an atomic transition.  Also, they're polarized s.t. ... something.  The point is, atoms moving against the direction of a red-detuned laser's propagation will see a doppler shifted laser frequency, tuned closer to the atomic transition, which makes a photon more likely to be absorbed.  Similarly, the opposite-propagating laser will appear to be further red-shifted away from resonance.  When a photon is absorbed, we require conservation of (linear) momentum, so the atom gets a ``push'' against the direction it was travelling.  This will slow the atom down, at least up to a limit related to the linewidth of the atomic transition and/or the laser.  There's something to look up.
%
%Anyway, when you have two counter-propagating red-detuned lasers, the net effect will be to slow the atom's motion down a bunch.  It's called an optical molasses, because the photons are sticky or whatever.  By itself, it does not confine atoms, it only slows them down.

%\note[jb1]{JB:  3.1.4 Angular Momentum and Selection Rules (that's this section!):
%\\
%Sorry, this section is almost entirely wrong, and you don't need it.
%Omit it please.}
%
%\note[jb1]{JB:  Agreed it's ok to ignore the repumper laser.}
%
%As in any other interaction, when a photon and an atom interact with one another, angular momentum must be conserved.
%%In any interaction, angular momentum must be conserved, and the interactions between atoms and photons are no exception.  
%An individual photon has spin 1, and therefore when we consider an atom-photon interaction where the photon is absorbed, the atom's total angular momentum projection \comment{(I think on any axis???)} must also change by one unit.
%\note{Fuck.  What even *are* the other rules?  Have to change F too?  I think that's true.. Clearly I have to look this up.}
%On a macroscopic level, the polarization of a laser can be used as a stand-in to describe, in a probabilistic way, the spin orientation of the individual photons of which the beam consists.  
%
%\note{I mean.  I probably don't need to go too in-depth here.  But I haven't mentioned it at all yet, and it's a relevant thing.}
%Polarization matters.  You have to conserve angular momentum.  In fact, you have to conserve both total angular momentum *and* its projection on whatever axis.  Photons have spin-1, but because they literally go at the speed of light, they can't do $0 \rightarrow 0$ transitions.  
%
%%%%This is related to why you need repumpers for your MOT, but also, I don't really want to get into that.  But also-also, why even *would* you?  You don't in the description I've already given.  Pretty sure it's because you can sometimes de-excite to a *stupid* set of energy levels.  And then, I don't think they really fall back down or something?  I've largely forgotten how it works.  Ugh.
%%%\note[done]{Removed `Angular Momentum and Selection Rules' section.  Because it was super wrong.}

%$\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, and $\hat{z}$ are coordinate unit vectors such that the $\hat{z}$ axis points along the axis of the anti-Helmholz coil.

%This shape implies that the magnitude of the field must be zero at some central point between the 
%surrounding the space in which the trap is formed, with the two coils' currents flowing anti-parallel to one another.

%\section{Photoionization as a Probe}
%\label{sec:photoprobe}
%\note[jb1]{JB on 3.5 `Photoionization as a probe' (that's this section!):
%\\
%You describe this well in 4.4 "Photoionization laser"
%\\
%So I recommend strongly you cut  the whole 3.5 section,
%because it's incomplete, and what you
%have contains errors.
%\\ ... \\
%Here are things there are not time to understand:
%\\ ... \\
%about 1/3 of the MOT atoms are excited, not 'a large fraction'
%\\ ... \\
%yes, we've intentionally polarized the OP laser to be circular so the
%atoms will be polarized. We've also picked the S 1/2 to P1/2 so that the
%fully stretched S1/2 $F=2$ $m_F=2$ state is dark. (Unlike the MOT, where we
%need the P3/2 state so that atoms never go dark,  or the force would stop.)
%But we agreed above not to talk about this.
%\\ ... \\
%"We have a photodiode(?) to observe what fraction of things get photoionized overall."
%\\ ... \\
%no, we look at the photoionization rate, for which we have the ion vs. photodiode TOF (`photodiode' looks at when the bursts of light occur)
%}
%
%So, the photoionization laser.  It ionizes only $\approx 1\%$ of the atoms, so it's mostly non-destructive.  
%
%For atoms in a MOT, it can give a projection of the trap position.  At least, it can if you add some MCPs with delay lines, and an electric field.  Also, the atoms have to be excited or they don't get photoionized this way.  That's because at any given time, a large fraction of the trapped atoms are in the excited state, so it works.
%
%For polarized or partially polarized atoms, absorption stops, because of selection rules.  We've intentionally polarized the laser to do this.  I think.  \aside[todoblue]{*Have* we even polarized the photoionization laser in any particular way?  I'm not sure we even have.  Why doesn't it absorb?  When it's stretched, it's not just all in the excited state!  It's...stretched.  Do angular momentum selection rules even apply if the electron is going into the continuum?}
%
%\note{Include a picture of the trap.  Possibly on both the rMCP and the eMCP.  Also, maybe a thing for the polarization as a function of time?  But I don't really need to do that, because it's in the paper.}
%
%Anyway, the probing only works if you have a detector to see what things.  We have a photodiode(?) to observe what fraction of things get photoionized overall.  This gives us polarization.  We also have an MCP with delay lines, and an electric field to guide (positive) ions into it.  And another MCP with delay lines on the other side of the electric field, to collect the electrons removed by photoionization.  Also, the (orbital) electrons removed during beta decay.  The photoionization laser is pulsed.  So, when there's a pulse, we can check whether there was a hit detected in the ion detector and/or the electron detector.  It turns out, we can't check both at the same time, because our two detectors hate each other.  They're natural enemies, really.  Turns out, the ion detector is better at measuring the polarization, and the trap position.  Because reasons.  \aside[org]{But it's worse for $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$, because .... reasons that probably shouldn't go in this chapter.}  Anyway, during the 2014 run, we spent like half of the beamtime collecting ions and half collecting electrons.  \aside[org]{This also doesn't go in this section.}

You would need to add in words that quantum mechanical corrections to this picture are in the optical Bloch equation approach in B. Fenker et al.  The depolarized states still have high nuclear polarization (1/2 for $F=2, M_F=1$, 5/6 for $F=1, M_F=1$) and determining the ratio of those two populations provides most of the info we need -- we model with the O.B.E, measure the optical pumping light polarization, and float an average transverse magnetic field.

We obtain a sample of neutral, cold, nuclear spin-polarized $^{37}\textrm{K}$ atoms with a known spatial position, via the TRIUMF accelerator facility, by intermittently running a magneto-optical trap (MOT) to confine and cool the atoms, then cycling the trap off to polarize the atoms.  With $\beta$ detectors placed opposite each other along the axis of polarization, we are able to directly observe the momenta of $\beta^+$ particles emitted into 1.4\% of the total solid angle nearest this axis.  We also are able to extract a great deal of information about the momentum of the recoiling $^{37\!}$Ar daughters by measuring their times of flight and hit positions on a microchannel plate detector with a delay line.  Because the nuclear polarization is known to within $<0.1\%$~\cite{ben_OP}, and we are able to account for many systematic effects by periodically reversing the polarization and by collecting unpolarized decay data while the atoms are trapped within the MOT, we expect to be well equipped to implement a test of `handedness' within the nuclear weak force.

%% when you have a changing current, and those will *also* make a magnetic field. So, the idea with an AC-MOT is that with a sinusoid, you have clear control over what the eddy currents are actually doing, and you can just shut the current off when the eddy currents are zero (current in the anti-Helmholtz coils will be close to zero at this time too, depending on frequency of the sinusoid...), so you can reduce the size of the eddy currents by like an order of magnitude.

Matsusada bipolar 20 KHz bandwidth 80A 20V amplifiers. The waveforms were carefully trimmed in amplitude and time to minimize B fields from eddy currents during the optical pumping cycle, again with the MCP assembly removed and the vacuum chamber up to air.
\\...\\
The bipolar amplifier bandwidth was inadequate when using current control mode, so voltage control had to be used, a much more time-exacting process requiring empirical iteration. These waveforms are not the same for the top and bottom coils, as during the optical pumping cycle one coil had to be flipped with respect to the MOT cycle to create the uniform vertical field for optical pumping by a Helmholtz rather than antiHelmholtz configuration.
\\...\\
The beta detector full assemblies were in place during the field trimming.
\\...\\
All materials near the trap cloud are chosen to minimize both magnetic permeability to suppress time-constant B field gradients and conductivity to suppress eddy currents. E.g., the E field electrodes are made from either glassy carbon semiconductor or titanium alloy. A copper ring (not pictured in Fig. 2.5) with a slit mounted on each beta detector stainless steel reentrant flange suppresses the worst eddy currents fighting the B field along the z-axis. These designs were all confirmed by finite element calculations of another collaboration member.

%%%Analysis is critical to a precision measurement, as most of the research is in determining systematic uncertainties by self-consistent analysis and simulations.  Each detector in this experiment is critical and has independent calibrations and cuts.

%%\section{Data Selection and Preliminary Cuts Mini-Intro from John}

%\note{We now consider how to clean up our data.  We make some fairly obvious, intuitive cuts, and those are described here.  Later, we'll make less intuitively obvious cuts.}
%
%
%%%%Although the detection chamber was designed to feature two MCP detectors on opposing sides of an applied electric field intended for simultaneous use (see Section~\ref{section:mcps}), in practice the two detectors produced quite a bit of feedback when operated at the same time.  In order to salvage usable data from the beamtime, we ended up running only one detector at a time, but switched which detector was in use every few hours, collecting approximately the same amount of data with each detector.  Thus, the runs are sorted into `electron' and `recoil' runs, depending on what the detector in use was intended to detect.  
%%%%
%%%%While the beta asymmetry and Fierz interference are best evaluated using the electron runs, the recoil runs are best for evaluating the polarization (a dominant uncertainty in the beta asymmetry measurement) and the cloud position.  The polarization measurement is the subject of a recent publication (see~\cite{ben_OP}), and the cloud position evaluation is discussed in more detail in Chapter~\ref{calibrations_chapter}.
%%%%
%%%%The data is further split up into four runsets:  A, B, C, and D based on when certain detection settings were adjusted, and each of these runsets contains both electron and recoil runs.  These four runsets were then treated separately for nearly all parts of the analysis.  In particular, Data Set A was neglected completely during analysis after it was determined that one scintillator had an improperly set hardware threshold such that lower energy betas weren't being detected at all.  Additionally, there was a QDC module failure between Runsets B and C, resulting in an abrupt change in calibration for the two scintillators.  
%%%%\note{`The observant reader may find it curious that the listed runsets start at ``B'' and continue alphabetically.

%	Beta decay (back-)scatter from surfaces within the experimental chamber is a significant systematic, and it must be evaluated, quantified, and corrected for.  This is done via a series of GEANT4 simulations.

It is therefore imperative that this be well understood.

	%This refers, in particular, to events in which a beta is emitted by a decay \emph{within the atom cloud} and travels across the chamber to be scattered from a surface.  Upon its incidence on a surface, the beta will lose a portion of its kinetic energy, and its trajectory is also changed.  


%a potential discriminatory handle presents itself in the beta time of flight -- as events in which the beta is scattered before its incidence on a detector 
%We note that 

%The SOEs are treated as being emitted isotropically, with their points of origin distributed according to the density of the central atom cloud.  Three separate TOF spectra are generated, with each corresponding to a different initial distribution of kinetic energy.  
%The origin of these SOE energy distributions is discussed in Section~\ref{section:soe_intro}.  

%\note{The SOE events were generated only up to 100 eV.  That smaller number of eV (20??) wasn't enough, even though the tail gets tiny.  Also, for higher energy SOEs, we observe a smaller fraction of the ones that are generated anyway.}

%\note{We do the COMSOL thing here too, but it becomes much more useful for the background events, because that's where the electric field is really non-uniform.}
%\note[bluetodo]{In the end, we used $(0.09)*(\textrm{0eV}) + (0.91)*(0.85*(\textrm{4S}) + 0.15*(\textrm{3P}))$.   That's $9+77+14$.  I will (eventually) say that *here*, not in the intro section.  Also, John used Eq.20 for the 4S, and Eq.24 for the 3P.}

It's believed to come from betas that hit the eMCP then scatter into a scintillator.  The phase space where this could even happen isn't very big, but you can still see the peak.  Probably not the other way around, because it's hard to scatter out of the whole scintillator, and if it just scattered off the DSSD then you wouldn't see it in the scintillator.

The beta TOF and SOE TOF spectra are combined by an event-by-event `subtraction', producing the simulated equivalent of an ``experimental SOE TOF'' spectrum (which, of course, is only a \emph{true} time-of-flight spectrum in the limit where the beta travel time is zero -- that is, since we cannot know the true time of decay, 

%%The two spectra are generated separately because different software is required for each type of particle.  The lower energy shake-off electrons may have their paths perturbed by any non-uniformities within the ambient electric field.  This is of particular concern in the regions far from the central path between the atom cloud and the eMCP, where non-uniformities are at their largest -- the very same regions from which many of these background events originate.  This is not the regime in which Geant4 is designed to operate. Furthermore, it turns out to be non-trivial to adequately model a non-uniform electric field within this framework.  As a result, the shake-off electron spectra were generated by the collaboration using COMSOL to model precise shape of the electric field within our experimental geometry.

%%The beta time of flight spectra from surfaces within the experimental chamber were generated with Geant4, in order to account for variations in travel time arising from beta scattering.  This also allows us to simultaneously account for energy lost to scattering within this background spectrum.

%%%%%\aside[jb]{JB:  Please comment on whether or not it was important to have this energy distribution.}  The point is, for each event, you've simulated a beta TOF that may or may not be scattered off of something before it hits a detector, and you have a SOE TOF for an event originating at that same point, so you subtract them to model the TOF you'd measure in an experiment.

The best existing measurement of $\bFierz$ is in the decay of the neutron~\cite{Saul2020},
$\bFierz$ = 0.017 $\pm$ 0.021, consistent with the Standard Model prediction of zero.
Our measurement is strongly related, yet complementary.
In terms on non-Standard Model Lorentz current structures, to lowest order in the non-SM  currents the same equation applies:
\\
$\bFierz$ = $\pm$ $(C_S +C_S' + (C_T - C_T') \lambda^2)/( 1 + \lambda^2)$
\\
(the plus is for $\beta^-$ decay and the - for $\beta^+$ decay)~\cite{jtw}.  [to be continued...] }

In our $^{37}$K case, $\lambda^2$ = $|M_{\rm GT}|^2$/$|M_{\rm F}|^2$ is close to 3/5 (the expected value j/(j+1) for a single j=3/2 d3/2 nucleon)~\cite{deShalit1963},
while for the neutron $\lambda^2$ is close to 3 (the expected value for an (j+1)/j j=1/2 s1/2 nucleon).
$|M_F|$, the Fermi matrix element, is nearly the same for both of these isospin = 1/2 decays (the largest correction is the larger isospin mixing of $\sim$0.01 in $^{37}$K).
So our observable is relatively less sensitive to Lorentz tensor currents, and will predominantly constrain or discover Lorentz scalar currents.
\\...\\ 
Full considerations would require a weighted fit of $\bFierz$ experiments and similar observables~\cite{Falkowski2021}, and are beyond the scope of this thesis.
The info from this thesis, values of $\Abeta$ and $\bFierz$ with their uncertainties, can together with the known $fT$ value (lifetime and
branching ratio) allow the community and/or the collaboration to include the results in a future constraint or discovery of scalar and tensor Lorentz currents
contributing to $\beta$ decay.}

%It is therefore possible to perform tests of the Standard Model by precisely measuring the kinematics within a beta decay process.

%\comment{ We obtain a sample of neutral, cold, nuclear spin-polarized $^{37}\textrm{K}$ atoms with a known spatial position, via the TRIUMF accelerator facility, by intermittently running a magneto-optical trap (MOT) to confine and cool the atoms, then cycling the trap off to polarize the atoms.  With $\beta$ detectors placed opposite each other along the axis of polarization, we are able to directly observe the momenta of $\beta^+$ particles emitted into 1.4\% of the total solid angle nearest this axis.  We also are able to extract a great deal of information about the momentum of the recoiling $^{37\!}$Ar daughters by measuring their times of flight and hit positions on a microchannel plate detector with a delay line.  Because the nuclear polarization is known to within $<0.1\%$~\cite{ben_OP}, and we are able to account for many systematic effects by periodically reversing the polarization and by collecting unpolarized decay data while the atoms are trapped within the MOT, we expect to be well equipped to implement a test of `handedness' within the nuclear weak force. }

%%In the limit of massless particles, the particle's chirality is the same as its helicity. Thus, in a left-handed model, the direction of an (ultrarelativistic) normal lepton's spin is antiparallel direction of its motion, and the direction of spin for an anti-lepton is parallel to its direction of motion.  For a non-relativistic particle the property of chirality is fairly abstract, and describes the appropriate group representation and projection operators to be used in calculations.  It should be noted that a fully chiral model is also one which is maximally parity violating.

%%This odd quirk of the nuclear weak force is not only \emph{predominantly} true, but it is, to the best of our current scientific knowledge, \emph{always} true -- that is, attempts to measure any right-handed chiral components of the weak force have produced results consistent with zero~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006}\cite{severijns_cuncic_2011}.  This project proposes a further measurement to constrain the strength of the right-handed component of the weak interaction.

%\section{The Principle of the Measurement}
%\label{principle}
%\comment{ Of particular interest is the decay process: $^{37}\textrm{K} \rightarrow \,^{37}\textrm{\!Ar} + \beta^{+} + \nu_e$.  Among other useful properties, this is is a `mirror' decay, 
%meaning that the nuclear wavefunctions of the parent and daughter are identical up to their isospin quantum number.  
%the number of protons in the parent nucleus (19) is equal to the number of neutrons in the daughter, and the number of neutrons in the parent (18) is equal to the number of protons in the daughter.  
%This property allows us to place strong constraints on the size of the theoretical uncertainties for this decay process within the Standard Model.   We further exploit this property by noting that both the $^{37}\textrm{K}$ parent and the $^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}$ daughter have nuclear spin $I=3/2$, a fact which is key to this experiment. }

%We propose to exploit the principle of conservation of angular momentum to search for right-handed currents.  Given a sample of cold, spatially confined, spin-polarized atoms which decay according to a known scheme, we propose to observe the kinematics of the daughter particles and thereby reconstruct beta decay event information.  
%
%In particular, given a fully spin-polarized ($m_I=\pm I$) 
%$\asdf37K$
%$^{37}\textrm{K}$ nucleus, the $^{37}\textrm{\!Ar}$ daughter may not take on a higher spin quantum number.  This puts a limit on the kinematics of the decay process.  If we assume, as per the Standard Model, that the spin-$1/2$ $\beta^+$ must emerge in a spin eigenstate parallel to its direction of motion (up to relativistic corrections), and that furthermore, the normal-matter $\nu_e$ must emerge with spin anti-parallel to its direction of motion.  Then, in the limiting case where the $\beta^+$ and the $\nu_e$ emerge exactly back-to-back, the Standard Model predicts that we will have changed the nuclear spin quantum number $m_I$ (as quantized along the `back-to-back' axis) by one unit.  However if, as per our assumption, the parent nucleus was already fully `spun up' in state $m_I = +3/2$, then $m_I$ may only decrease.
%
%In terms of beta decay kinematics, this means that given a $^{37}\textrm{K}$ nucleus which is spin-polarized to point upwards, if we observe a `back-to-back' decay along the axis of polarization, the Standard Model tells us that we can expect that the $\beta^+$ has gone upwards and the $\nu_e$ has gone downwards.  If we observe an event where the opposite is true, then we will have observed `new' physics beyond the predictions of the Standard Model (See Figure~\ref{fig:rhc}).

%	\caption{ A list of the `back-to-back' polarized $\beta^+$ decays in a simplified one-dimensional geometry.  The decays are labelled according to the type(s) of interaction that could produce them (vector, axial vector, scalar, and tensor).  By fully spin-polarizing the parent nucleus in a mirror decay, we are able to exclude diagrams (a) and (b).  Diagram (c), which represents the `left-handed' linear combination of vector and axial vector interactions, is the only one of these processes allowed within the Standard Model. Subfigure (d) represents the `right-handed' combination of vector and axial vector interactions.  Subfigures (e), (f), (g), and (h) could be produced by linear combinations of scalar and tensor interactions, neither of which have been observed within the Standard Model.  
%Within our experimental set-up we do not measure the spin of daughter particles directly, and therefore the decays in the top row (a, c, e, g) would be indistinguishable from one another, and decays in the bottom row (b, d, f, h) would also be indistinguishable from one another.  However since none of the latter event types would be possible under the Standard Model, an observation of this event type would be indicative of the presence of scalar, tensor, or right-handed interactions within the nuclear weak force.

%The problem, then, becomes one of designing an experiment which will allow us to isolate beta decay events with the desired signature from the more mundane beta decay events predicted by the Standard Model.  

%
%\section{The Experimental Setup}

%The TRIUMF Neutral Atom Trap (TRINAT) offers an experimental set-up which is uniquely suited to precision tests of Standard Model beta decay physics.  Radioactive ions are delivered from the ISAC beamline and neutralized before being trapped in the first of two magneto-optical traps (MOTs).  Approximately once per second, atoms from the first MOT are transferred to the second, where their decay products can be observed with significantly less background than would have been possible in the first trap (see Figure~\ref{fig:doublemot}).  The transfer methodology is discussed in some detail in a paper by Swanson et al~\cite{swanson}.
%
%Once the newly transferred atoms -- in this case, neutral $^{37}\textrm{K}$ -- have arrived at the second trap, the MOT cycles 500 times between a state where it is `on' and actively confining atoms to a region of approximately 2\,mm$^3$, to a state where it is `off' and instead the atoms are spin-polarized by optical pumping while the atom cloud expands ballistically before being re-trapped.  In order to eliminate systematic effects, the polarization direction is flipped every 16 seconds.  This optical pumping technique and its results are the subject of a recent publication~\cite{ben_OP}.

%	\caption{An alternating-current magneto-optical trap with a duty cycle optimized for producing polarized atoms}	
%	\label{fig:themot}
%\end{figure}
%
%The need to use an AC-MOT rather than a typical MOT has arisen as a direct result of our desire to optimally polarize our sample of atoms.  Polarization is incompatible with the non-uniform magnetic field used by a MOT, and rapidly shutting off the current used to produce the MOT's magnetic field produces eddy currents in the surrounding materials, which in turn produce their own non-uniform magnetic field in the region of interest.  The AC-MOT is developed as a way to ensure that the unavoidable eddy currents are behaving as we expect.  With an appropriate choice of shut-off phase, the current in the coils can be shut off when the overall magnetic field is already zero, so that no further eddy currents are induced.   
%

%
%In order to optimally polarize a sample of atoms by this method, it is necessary to have precise control over the magnetic field.  This is because absent other forces, a spin will undergo Larmor precession about the magnetic field lines.  In particular, the magnetic field must be aligned along the polarization axis (otherwise the tendency will be to actually depolarize the atoms), and it must be uniform in magnitude over the region of interest (otherwise its divergencelessness will result in the field also having a non-uniform direction, which results in a spatially-dependent depolarization mechanism).  Note that this type of magnetic field is not compatible with the MOT, which requires a quadrupolar magnetic field \emph{gradient}, and has necessitated our use of the AC-MOT as described in Subsection~\ref{trap}.

%
%In order to make best use of these MCPs, we create an electric field in order to draw positively charged particles into one MCP, while drawing negatively charged electrons into the other MCP.  Seven electrostatic hoops have been placed within the chamber (see Figure~\ref{fig:thechamber}), and are connected to a series of high voltage power supplies.  See Sections~\ref{photoions} and~\ref{pos_recoils} for a discussion of what sort of charged particles we expect to observe in these detectors and how they are created.  
%  

%Scientific data has been collected at field strengths of 395 V/cm, 415 V/cm, and 535 V/cm.  It should be noted that these field strengths are too low to significantly perturb any but the least energetic of the (positively charged) betas from the decay process, and these low energy betas would already have been unable to reach the upper and lower beta detectors due to interactions with materials in the SiC mirror and Be foil vacuum seal.

\\...\\
hi Melissa,
\\...\\
I think you should keep Section 6.2, but I think it would be clearer to point out the observable manifests as a dip in the raw TOF spectrum, not going all the way to zero as in the ideal on-axis situation you describe for simplicity.
I.e., I would say you need to qualify this "exactly" word (emphasis mine below), and since
it ends up as a cos(theta) distribution like in my attached slide on the subject, your figure of the TOF spectrum would be a good way to do that.
\\...\\
"Henceforth, daughter nuclei from a back-to-back decay as shown in
Figure ?? will be described as ‘slow’ recoils. In terms of observables, this means that
if the electric field is configured to point along one of the axes perpendicular to the
polarization direction, then when the recoiling ion is swept away into a detector, the
slow recoil’s hit position should be \textbf{exactly}​​ along the projection of the polarization
axis. Furthermore, the slow recoil’s time of flight should be in the middle of the time
of flight spectrum, since other recoils will be emitted with momentum towards or
away from the detector"

%\section{Proposed Project}
%\label{project}
%Using $^{37}\textrm{K}$ beta decay data collected in June 2014, I intend to reconstruct the recoil momenta both along the polarization axis and perpendicular to it, such that when combined with energy and hit position from the beta detectors, each event's full kinematics may be reconstructed.  The spectra created by these events will be compared against a series of Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations.  
%
%Matched template fitting will be used to compare the experimental data to the simulation, meaning that the implicit vector, axial, scalar, and tensor couplings within Eq.~\ref{jtw_pdf} will be allowed to float separately within the simulation, and a series of simulation ``templates'' will be produced, and each separately fit to the data.  The quality of each fit will be used to determine a ``best'' experimental value for both parameters, as well as the error inherent in the measurement.

%%%\subsection{Status of the $R_{\textrm{slow}}$ Measurement}
%%%\label{rslow_status}
%%%In June 2014, after several years of preparatory work beforehand (the author has been continuously involved with this project since 2010), approximately 7 days of beam time at TRIUMF was dedicated to the TRINAT $^{37}\textrm{K}$ beta decay experiment.  Approximately half of this data is suitable for use in this project.  During this period, approximately 10,000 atoms were held within the trap at any given time.  The cleaned spectra show around 50,000 polarized beta-recoil coincidence events in total, divided among measurements at three different electric field strengths (535 V/cm, 415 V/cm, 395 V/cm). 
%%%
%%%%At the present time, analysis is underway.  The recoil MCP hit position data has been calibrated, and systematic effects in the trap position and size measurements are being considered.  The largest two remaining hurdles for the analysis both lie in improvements to the Monte Carlo.  
%%%
%%%%The first challenge is to implement particle tracking within a \emph{non-uniform} electric field.  Using the true non-uniform electric field will shift the time-of-flight spectra overall by around 1\%, and is expected to change the \emph{shape} of spectra as well, since the deviation from uniformity changes significantly as a function of flight tragectory, and is greater the farther a particle ventures from the central axis.  This would affect the measured hit positions as well.  Taken together, the shape of the time-of-flight spectra (as in Figure~\ref{fig:Rslow_tof}) and the recoil hit position are critical to our reconstruction of the decay process, it is critical that we model them correctly.  
%%%
%%%%The second challenge will be to allow our simulation to vary vector, axial, scalar, and tensor coupling constants separately while holding other physical parameters (such as the half-life and Fermi/Gamow-Teller ratio) constant.  This, too, will be absolutely critical to the analysis, and its implementation is likely to be non-trivial.
%%%
%%%A fit to simulation has shown that the data that has already been collected has sufficient statistical power to measure the \emph{fractional} contribution of any polarized `new physics' beta decay parameter (ie right-handed, scalar, and tensor currents within the weak interaction) to a sensitivity of $\sim 2\%$ of its true value.  Systematic limitations are still being assessed.  
%%%%Because previous measurements have already shown that any $(V-A)$, $S$, and $T$ terms within the Standard Model must be quite small~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006}\cite{severijns_cuncic_2011}, the present measurement is not likely to be able to add any new constraints to our understanding of Standard Model physics, and must instead be understood as complementary to previous measurements.
%%%%Because previous measurements have 
%%%%Quantifying this observable's sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model in comparison to previously measured constraints~\cite{severijns_beck_cuncic_2006}\cite{severijns_cuncic_2011} is work in progress.

%%%
%%%
%%%%Approximately of beamtime and several years of preparatory work beforehand, and its analysis is currently underway.  The statistical strength of our data is sufficient for a \comment{5\%?  (John said 5\%, but I don't really know how he calculated that...)} measurement to constrain right-handed weak interactions, however the systematic effects within the data have not yet been fully evaluated.  This constraint is far too weak to allo w for the discovery of a right-handed component of the nuclear weak force, and is likely also too weak to place any new constraints on its strength.  It could, at best, lend statistical strength to the constraints on right-handed currents that have already been observed.
%%%%
%%%%Unfortunately, due to beam scheduling and target creation procedures at TRIUMF, and because several components of the TRINAT science chamber have subsequently been removed and disassembled to prepare for future upgrades to the apparatus, it would be extremely difficult to collect any further data in a timely fashion.

%\section{Stuff from John}
\note[jbn, nolist]{Another Round of Thoughts from John!
\\...\\
Fitting Ben's data (using for the bFierz function my convolution of 1/E with a Clifford tail) as I've shown before, compare what happens if I let Abeta float, or if I then fix Abeta arbitrarily to that floated value.
\\
That's not a well-motivated thing to do on its own, but it's not that much different than using Abeta[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] constrained by Ft[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] since that's only dependent on squares of small quantities.
\\...\\
So I would expect the ability to extract Cs and Ct from the 37K data to have more
sensitivity if Abeta[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] and Ft[Cs$^2$,Ct$^2$] and bFierz[Cs,Ct] are floated together in a 2d fit rather then floating Abeta and bFierz without any theoretical constraints and then considering getting linear combinations of Cs and Ct from the bFierz value.
\\...\\
Note that my simply fixing Abeta lowers bFierz uncertainty by a factor of 3. I expect similar improvement in sensitivity to Cs and Ct.

another basic big point. What would it mean if there were nonzero Cs, Ct?

In the context of the more elegant SM, a theory of quarks and leptons and mathematically consistent interactions, that would imply the existence of at least one extra unknown exchange boson. The mass would not be measured, just its coupling
strenghts to the particles participating in the beta decay.

Maybe background to understand that includes:
\\
If one were to write the SM weak interaction, $C_A$ and $C_V$ and $C_A$ and $C_V g_A$ would all be constants with abs value 1.
The (1+- gamma\_5)'s are projection operators-- in the SM, the W boson only couples to left-handed nu's and right-handed antinu's
