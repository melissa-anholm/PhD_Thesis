%	\note{MUST check to make sure I didn't use Run 420 in ``good runs" in the end!!!}
%	\note{I have more (really early) runs classed in Set A than Ben had.  In the end, we didn't use them so it doesn't matter.  But...what?}
	\note{Ugh.  My categorization system is slightly different than Ben's on the later recoils.  That's annoying.}
%	\note{Other things I could list here:  Electric field strengths, total runtime.}
	\caption[List of Runs]{A list of 2014 online runs with potentially usable data.  Runset A was discarded completely due to problems with hardware threshold settings.  There was a QDC module failure before Run 450, so it and all subsequent runs were performed using a different module, and as a result the scintillator calibrations changed slightly at this time.  Anyway, the point of this thing is to show which electron runs and recoil runs go together, for the purposes of evaluating polarization and cloud attributes.}
