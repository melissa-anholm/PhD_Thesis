\input{appendix_old_holsteinjtwconfusion} % JB says:  Appendix D -> internal document
\input{appendix_old_MultipoleComparisons} % JB says:  Keep Appendix E iff you can clean it up in one (1) hour. Otherwise -> internal

%\input{appendix_old_thesisproposal}       % JB says:   Appendix I  keep, it's excellent. It should be moved as is to Conclusions under "Future Experiment for the collaboration"! so people know you worked so hard on it!!

%\input{appendix_old_fuckingduh}           % JB says:  Appendix J -> internal
\input{appendix_superratio}				   % JB says:  "Appendix KLM you have to pick what you want-- I hope that's Appendix K-- and remove the rest as you say they're "old". Appendix K could be moved to the end of Experimental Methods because it's absolutely critical and helpful!! but if you want to reference it there and leave it as an Appendix, it's up to you."
