\note{I see some stuff in my old Appendix D that needs to be moved (in here?  Or maybe in Old Appendix E) before it goes away forever.}
\note[color=jb]{JB:  Appendix C has some redundancies with B. You will have to sort that out.  (n.b.:  from context, it's less clear which appendices he's actually talking about, but whatever, there's certainly redundancies all around.}

%\section{Comparing Notation between Holstein and JTW}
\section{Comparison Guide}
	This is a short guide to differences in notation, sign convention, and normalization.  There are several tables here, chosen to aid in conversion between the two conventions.  %In the mean time, here's a bunch of old handwritten notes on the topic, that I'll eventually have to typeset and process into something intelligible.  
This section also includes handwritten notes.

%Here's a table.
\input{table_comparenotation_kinematic}        % table:compare_notation_kinematic

%Here's another table.
\input{table_comparenotation_angularmomentum}  % table:compare_notation_angularmomentum

%Here's a third table.
\input{table_comparenotation_multipoles}       % table:compare_notation_multipoles
%
%Here's a fourth table.
\input{table_integrals_by_inspection}          % table:integrals_by_inspection



%\section{Some old handwritten notes.}
%One day, these will go away and be replaced by nice clean latex.
