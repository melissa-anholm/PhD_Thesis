6. At first glance, I find a bibliography that contains only 28 entries to be problematic for a Ph.D. thesis. This goes, to some degree, back to my earlier points about embedding the work in the “bigger picture” – doing so would necessarily lead to several additional references – but it might be more than that.

% Note:  I can either put the Bibliography/biblist_whatever explicitly in the thingy where I load the bibliographies, or else I can just *not* put the main root document in a magic line at the top.
