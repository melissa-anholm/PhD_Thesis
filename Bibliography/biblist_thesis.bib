abstract = {The response of a hybrid detector telescope to mono-energetic beams of positrons and electrons has been determined. The particle beams were obtained from the Chalk River iron-free π√2 beta spectrometer, which was equipped with radioactive sources of 66Ga and 106Ru. The measured positron response function was described by one constant and six energy dependent parameters, whereas two constant and three energy dependent parameters sufficed for the electron case. We conclude from a comparison of the detector response for the two types of particles that the practice of deriving positron response functions from measured electron response functions is inadequate for experiments where good precision is required.}
