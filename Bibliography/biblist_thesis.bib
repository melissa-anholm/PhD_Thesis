abstract = {The response of a hybrid detector telescope to mono-energetic beams of positrons and electrons has been determined. The particle beams were obtained from the Chalk River iron-free π√2 beta spectrometer, which was equipped with radioactive sources of 66Ga and 106Ru. The measured positron response function was described by one constant and six energy dependent parameters, whereas two constant and three energy dependent parameters sufficed for the electron case. We conclude from a comparison of the detector response for the two types of particles that the practice of deriving positron response functions from measured electron response functions is inadequate for experiments where good precision is required.}

abstract = {We re-evaluate the ƒt-values and their radiative corrections for the eight superallowed β+ decays for which very accurate data are available and also include the results for 10C, for which the measurements are approaching a similar accuracy. The main new feature is a recalculation of the nuclear-structure dependent part CNS of the O(α) radiative correction using wave functions more realistic than those used previously. This determines the value of the element Vud of the quark mixing matrix. Moreover, we recalculate Vus in the framework of a quark model. The resulting values of these two matrix elements indicate a violation of unitarity of the mixing matrix. We discuss implications of this regarding possible extensions of the minimal version of the standard model of electroweek interactions.}

The impact of the correction is to give a modest improvement in the test of the conserved-vector-current (CVC) hypothesis, and a slightly smaller value of the quark-mixing matrix element, Vud. The test of the unitary of the first row of the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix gives: Vud2 + νus2 + Vub2 = 0.9962 ± 0.0016, violating the three-generation standard model. Hints from neutron-only data suggest that nuclear-structure corrections in superallowed Fermi β-decay are still not fully under control.}
