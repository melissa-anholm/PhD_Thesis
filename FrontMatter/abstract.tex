%The nuclear weak force is known to be a predominantly left-handed vector and axial-vector (V-A) interaction.  An experiment is proposed to further test that observation, constraining the strength of right-handed (V+A) currents by exploiting the principle of conservation of angular momentum within a spin-polarized beta decay process.  Here, we focus on the decay \mbox{$^{37}\textrm{K} \rightarrow \,^{37}\textrm{\!Ar} + \beta^{+} + \nu_e$}.  The angular correlations between the emerging daughter particles provide a rich source of information about the type of interaction that produced the decay.
The nuclear weak interaction is known to feature both vector and axial-vector couplings in a dominant role, however the presence of scalar and tensor couplings cannot be ruled out entirely.~\aside[color=jbn]{Needs a more general sentence to start, and then needs to say what space these are 'vectors, ...tensors' in.}
In beta decay physics, the Fierz interference, $\bFierz$, is an observable comprised of a linear combination of scalar and tensor couplings, and can be measured as an adjustment to the shape of the resultant beta energy spectrum.  A precision measurement experiment is conducted to observe the $\beta^+$ decay of spin-polarized $^{37}$K from an atom cloud intermittently confined by a magneto-optical trap, and  the beta energy spectra are observed in two detectors on opposing sides of the cloud, along the axis of polarization.  This geometry, combined with a knowledge of the polarization, allows the superratio asymmetry to be constructed, providing an observable which is particularly sensitive to the value of $\bFierz$, while simultaneously eliminating contributions from a variety of systematic effects.  Geant4 simulations are used to model scattering effects that could mimic the signal being searched for.  The resulting measurement gives $\mbox{\!$\bFierz = +0.033 \pm 0.084(\textrm{stat}) \pm 0.039(\textrm{syst})$\!}$, consistent with the Standard Model.~\aside[color=jbn]{Needs a sentence on why that's interesting.}
